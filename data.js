        "description": "<p>After the retirement of Jeff Thomson, the cricketing world didn't a better slinging bowler than Lasith Malinga. The Galle-born speedster is one of the very few world-class pacers that Sri Lanka has produced over the years.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nMalinga grew up playing on the sandy beaches of Galle with a softball where he developed his unique round-arm action to deliver his trademark toe-crushing yorkers that led to his nickname, 'Slinga'. He later made his debut for Galle in 2001-02 and developed a fearsome reputation in domestic cricket for hurling deliveries consistently at the toes of batsmen which made it difficult to pick because of his unusual point of delivery, in front of the umpire's frame.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nA well-thought-out move by the Sri Lankan selectors to include Malinga in the 2004 Australia tour paid off as he single-handedly rattled the Australian batsmen by picking 10 wickets in the two Tests. Later in Napier, he ripped through New Zealand's batting order bagging nine wickets in the game. He made his ODI debut against UAE in 2004 and was one of Sri Lanka's standout bowlers in the 2007 World Cup where he picked up a phenomenal 4 wickets off 4 balls against South Africa in a game.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nA wonderful exponent of the yorker, Malinga's awkward action helped him generate disconcerting bounce and he also had a very well-disguised slower delivery up his arsenal. However, injuries often kept him out of the playing eleven. Malinga retired pre-maturely from Tests in 2011, owing to a persistent knee injury but insisted on continuing in the shorter formats of the game.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nMalinga has been an asset to his Indian T20 League franchise Mumbai, who owe a large chunk of their success to the Lankan pacer. His best performance for Mumbai came in the 2011 edition when he finished as tournament's leading wicket-taker with 28 wickets. Malinga was also a part of the Big Bash League in Australia with Melbourne Stars where he bowled a blistering spell, picking up 6 wickets, conceding 7 runs in 4 overs against Perth Scorchers, his personal best T20 figures as well as the best figures in T20s on Australian soil.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAfter retiring from Tests, 'Slinga' continued to be the strike bowler for Sri Lanka in the limited-overs format. His biggest success came in 2014 when he led Sri Lanka to their first World T20 triumph, defeating India in the finals, a fitting send-off to Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara who played their final T20I.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nWith age catching up and issues with his fitness, Malinga let go his captaincy ahead of Sri Lanka's 2016 World T20 campaign. He spent his time outside the squad more than inside due to his injuries. Lasith was appointed as the bowling mentor by the Mumbai franchise in 2018 and the following year, won them their 4th trophy playing as a bowler.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nParticipating in his last ODI World Cup in 2019, Lasith Malinga wasn't at his usual best but still emerged as the most successful bowler for Sri Lanka. Post that event, Lasith Malinga announced his retirement from ODI cricket and got a winning farewell against Bangladesh.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe Lankan board appointed Malinga as the captain of the T20I squad to face New Zealand in 2019. The veteran however failed to inspire Sri Lanka to a series win, his heroics in the last T20I reminded one and all why he's one of the best going around in the business. On that record-making evening, Lasith became the first bowler to take 100 international wickets in T20Is and also picked up his fifth international hat-trick, the most by any bowler. Also, Malinga grabbed four wickets in four consecutive balls, a feat only achieved by Rashid Khan in this format. Targeting the 2020 World T20, Sri Lanka would be hoping for Malinga to revive their fortunes.</p>",

The short-arm jabs, the murderous cuts and the delightful lofted flicks are reminiscent of one of world cricket's most destructive batsman but there is more to Mathurage Don Kusal Janith Perera than meets the eye.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA left-handed batsman and wicketkeeper, Kusal Perera represented the Sri Lankan U19 squad regularly since 2007. He was then called up to the side for the U19 World Cup in Malaysia the following year. An aggressive batsman, Perera made his first-class debut for the Colts Cricket Club in 2009 and scored his maiden fifty.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso a part of the Sri Lankan A side, Perera was included in Ruhunu's Champions League T20 squad in 2011. Two years later, Kusal was called up to Sri Lanka's ODI side for their series against Australia, where he made his international debut. His reputation as a smasher early on in the innings inevitably drew comparisons with Sanath Jayasuriya's style of play and that brought Perera some rich dividends none more so than being roped in by the cash rich Indian T20 League for it's sixth season in 2013. He represented the Rajasthan franchise but managed to play only a couple of games.  Sri Lanka stuck with him and he rewarded their faith late in the year 2013 with a Man of the Match performance in the second T20I against Pakistan that secured Sri Lanka's no.1 ranking in the format. A lot of expectations are on the shoulders of this youngster and it would be his loss if he doesn't make his talent count.</p>",

So good was his control, that Mahela quickly vouched for his inclusion in the national side. He was then included in the final squad of 15 for the WT20. Dananjaya made his international debut in a T20I against New Zealand, picking up two wickets in the spell. Consequently, he made his ODI debut against the same opposition. In 2013, he was picked by the IPL franchise Chennai Super Kings for the tournament's sixth season.</p>",

Yogesh Takawale comes from a poor family background, but aims for the sky.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA talented right-handed batsman, Takawale was first chosen to represent his state in a Ranji Trophy game against the Railways in 2006. Also an able wicket-keeper, he initially started out as a specialist batsman, but his keeping abilities turned out to be equally impressive. A decent fifty against the visiting Australians and topping the batting charts of the following Ranji season earned him a place in the Mumbai squad for the 2008 IPL. He had a learning experience there, playing amongst the likes of Sachin Tendulkar and other senior players and he also enjoyed a short trip to Israel with a fringe Indian squad.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, despite being in good form, Takawale was ignored by the selectors to play first-class cricket for his home team post the IPL. Having played for Maharashtra from age-group levels and not being offered a place even in form, resulted in him switching to Tripura in the 2010-11 domestic season. In the Indian T20 league, 2014 player auction, Bangalore bought him for Rs.10 lakhs.</p>",

A century against the touring Australia Under-19 team in 2014 was enough to prove his worth and he soon found himself in the 2016 Under-19 World Cup squad. The tournament didn't go as per his standard although his match-winning 95 runs off 96 balls against England in the quarterfinal gave the world a glimpse of his potential. He followed that up with a couple of centuries against the same team in a bilateral series and earned his first call-up to the national ODI team.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAt the age of 18, without playing any First Class or List A or T20 game, Fernando was handed his ODI debut against Australia. The young man received a harsh reality check in his first international outing as Mitchell Starc sent him packing in just two balls for a duck.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nFollowing that, Avishka made his First Class debut a few months later against a touring West Indies A team. After gaining some experience under his belt, Avishka once again was selected in the limited-overs team for the tour of South Africa in 2019 but he failed to impress.

        "description": "<p>Vishnu Vinod is a wicket-keeper batsman hailing from Kerala and is known for his aggressive batting style. He opens the batting for them but is quite flexible with the ability to bat at any position. In the 2016-17 Inter-State T20 competition, he scored 199 in 4 matches at a strike rate of 164.46 which included 14 sixes, the most by anyone. This handed him an opportunity to represent South Zone in the Syed Musthaq Ali T20 trophy. There too, he put on an attacking display, striking at 161.90.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAll these performances and his hard work in the U-23 and U-25 level saw him finally get a place in the Kerala Ranji trophy team. He scored a half century on debut and also added some more runs in his kitty in the following games. He had a similar run in the Vijay Hazare trophy. His big moment, however, came in the 2016 Indian T20 League when he received a call-up from the Bangalore franchise to replace the injured KL Rahul. He straightaway made debut for them but had a forgetful season with just single digit scores in each match.  </p>",

Having sporting interests in squash and swimming, the southpaw chose to play cricket over any other sport. Bhanuka started playing cricket in his college days representing the Royal College Colombo. After becoming a key member of his college team, Bhanuka made his T20 and List A debut during his teenage in 2009 representing the Schools Invitation XI and Sinhalese Sports Club respectively and further advanced into Sri Lanka's U-19 team.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nBhanuka was also part of the 2010 Youth World Cup where he successfully showcased his skills by amassing 253 runs in the tournament. Before the 2010 U-19 World Cup, he had an exceptional tour in Australia where he smashed 154 off 111 deliveries for Sri Lanka U-19 and also ended up as the leading run-scorer of the series. Such extraordinary performances at the Youth level earned him the \"Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year\" award in 2011 and he was also felicitated with the Young Emerging Player of Under 19 Category.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nRajapaksa made his first-class debut for the Sinhalese Sports Club in 2011 and since then has been a regular face in the domestic circuit. Even though Bhanuka has been playing domestic cricket for years, he failed to grab the attention of the national selectors until 2019. Keeping in mind his three-dimensional abilities, the selectors named him in Sri Lanka's T20 squad for the Pakistan tour in September 2019 after most of the prime players opted out of the series due to security reasons.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nBhanuka didn't waste much time in impressing everyone with his batting ability. In the second T20I, he stroked a fluent 77 and was involved in a record third-wicket partnership for Sri Lanka. Rajapaksa finished as the leading run-scorer of the 3-match T20I series and proved his mettle with the bat.</p>",

His pace, variety and movement are an added advantage to Leicestershire's seam department. He took his maiden five-for in 2009 in a first-class game against Surrey, and also enjoyed a brilliant T20 season. A year later, he bagged his first List A five-wicket haul. Despite the presence of some big names like Matthew Hoggard and the form of Nathan Buck and Nadeem Malik, Gurney held his nerve and remained an integral part of the team. In 2011, he emerged as Leicestershire's leading wicket-taker in the domestic T20 competition with 23 wickets. </p>",

        "description": "<p>As a 16-year old, Alex Hales hit 52 runs off a single over in a game of the Cricket Idol T20 tournament in 2005 held at Lord's, that included three no-balls, eight sixes and one four. Some called him the next Kevin Pietersen, while others ridiculed at the irony of selecting him as a fast bowler in the competition.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nBorn in Hillingdon, Middlesex, the tall right-handed batsman first played for Buckinghamshire in 2006 before he went on to make his first-class debut for Nottinghamshire in 2008, after scoring a century in only his second appearance for the Notts in 2007. Hales had a very successful 2008, as he represented the England Under-19s and played some wonderful cricket in their youth Test matches and one-dayers. He impressed with a batting average of 50 in Tests and 30 in the one-day arena. Hales was then named in England's Performance Programme squad in the winter of 2009-10. Such was the impact he created on the domestic front, that he received a surprise maiden international call-up to England's Twenty20 squad in 2011, to face India in their one-off T20I at Old Trafford. It was a forgettable debut as Hales was out on a duck. However, in his 5th T20I, he became the first cricketer in T20I history to be dismissed on 99.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAfter that, he continued to be in England's T20 squad and kept getting runs on a consistent basis. In the 2014 World T20, Hales hammered the Sri Lankan bowlers all over the park and registered his maiden century for England which also turned out to be the first century by an English batsman in T20Is. Continuous dominance in the T20 format finally reaped rewards for Hales as he was drafted into the ODI squad. His debut came against India at home in which he couldn't quite live up to the expectations. He was also disappointing in the next series against Sri Lanka but still, England persisted with him and named him in the 2015 World Cup squad. Alex did not get the chance to open the batting, except for one game, as Ian Bell and Moeen Ali were the preferred openers.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nSoon after the World Cup debacle, England revamped their ODI unit and totally branded themselves as a new-look side under Eoin Morgan. Alex Hales was given the freedom to play aggressively at the top and contributed a lot in turning England's ODI fortunes. His biggest achievement till date has been a 171-run marathon knock against Pakistan at Trent Bridge in 2016 to break the 23-year-old record held by Robin Smith for the best individual score by an Englishman. Although Hales' record stood for around 17 months as his opening partner, Jason Roy, smashed 180 against Australia to take that record away.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAfter the retirement of Andrew Strauss and with lack of options to partner Alastair Cook in the Test side, Hales was given a chance to showcase his talent in the longest format of the game. But after getting a run of 11 Tests, he was eventually dropped due to a string of low scores. That did not do any harm to Hales' success as he made the most of that time by giving some stellar performances for his domestic side, Nottinghamshire, and eventually played a crucial role in taking his team to glory in both the Royal London Cup as well as the T20 Blast. Hales has also represented Mumbai in the 2018 Indian T20 League.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAlex Hales has been the key to England's limited overs side as well as the T20 format. However, with the emergence of Jonny Bairstow as a destructive opener in white-ball cricket meant that Hales had to lose his opening spot and come down as a number 3 batsman. Getting selected in England's 2019 World Cup squad didn't come as a surprise but in a bizarre turn of events, Hales then was handed a 21-day ban for recreational drug use which eventually resulted in his omission from the World Cup squad.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Arguably one of the best all-rounders this game has ever seen, Shakib Al Hasan is an extraordinary talent and a player for all formats. He has been bossing the ICC Rankings for all-rounders for many years without much competition and has put his name among many greats of the game.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe Magura-born Shakib made his ODI debut in 2006 primarily as a bowler, but over time started concentrating on his batting. However, his bowling talents were re-discovered in the 2008 home Test series against New Zealand where in an exceptional first game, he ran through the Kiwi line-up with figures of 7-37 in the first innings and a fluent 71 in the second innings also reiterated his batting skills. Gradually, he became the undisputed all-rounder in the side. His growth as a player saw him being elevated to vice-captaincy in 2009 and Shakib showed he was up for captaincy when as a stand-in captain for the second Test against West Indies in 2009, he led Bangladesh to their first ever victory on foreign soil.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nMashrafe Mortaza's injury saw Shakib getting a prolonged shot at captaincy and though his stints as the captain had its highs and lows, he continued to come through leaps and bounds as a player. But in mid-2010, he decided to give up captaincy. However, fate had other plans as Mortaza once again fell prey to injury and Shakib was asked to lead the side in the home ODI series against New Zealand in which Bangladesh thrashed the Kiwis by a whopping 4-0 margin. The following year, Bangladesh toured Zimbabwe to play a one-off Test and five ODIs. Under skipper Shakib, the team put up a disastrous performance as Zimbabwe beat them by 136 runs in their only Test and also clinched the ODI series 3-2. Immediate repercussions of the defeat saw Shakib being axed by the Bangladesh Cricket Board.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe all-rounder was signed by the Kolkata franchise in the Indian T20 League for the 2011 season and was retained the following year and did well enough to be bought back in 2014 for the 7th season. After a disastrous World Twenty20 2014 at home, which saw Bangladesh even slump to lowly-ranked Hong Kong in the qualifiers, Shakib suggested that his side should not play home games for two years to help reduce expectations from cricket fans in the country and also expressed his worry for the lack of talent and cricket infrastructure in the country.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe Bangla superstar continued his progress as an all-round cricketer and established himself as the most utility player in the squad. Bangladesh benefited from his contributions in all the formats and Shakib rarely disappointed. He was a key member in  Bangladesh's golden period in 2015 when they defeated teams like Pakistan, South Africa and India at home in an ODI series.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nDuring the tour of New Zealand in 2017, Shakib became only the third Bangladesh batsman to score a Test double century after Tamim Iqbal and Mushfiqur Rahim. Apart from displaying his class with the bat in the longer format of the game, Shakib also ply his trade for many T20 Leagues across the globe. In the 2018 season of the Indian T20 League, Shakib was bought by Sunrisers Hyderabad.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe extraordinary success of Shakib, the all-rounder, meant that many records tumbled at his feet. He became the fastest to the double of 250 wickets and 6000 runs in 2019, getting there in 202 ODIs, 92 better than the next best (294 by Shahid Afridi). Shakib was also the second Bangladeshi to get 6000 ODI runs after Tamim Iqbal. One of the biggest achievements of Shakib's career though came during the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup where the star player became the first all-rounder to score over 600 runs and take ten wickets in a single World Cup. Adding to that, Shakib matched Yuvraj's rare World Cup record of scoring a fifty and claiming a fifer in the same match. Through his extraordinary all-round prowess, Shakib was destined for success and he's en route to create many more records for Bangladesh.</p>",

Although he has a decent first-class record, he is seen by many as an ideal cricketer in the limited-over formats.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nPollard's impressive domestic performances caught the eye of the national selectors, which then resulted in his ODI debut in 2007. A debut in a World Cup was followed by a recall for the ODI series against New Zealand in 2008. Pollard scores a high proportion of his runs in boundaries, smashing the ball to all corners of the ground. He has produced some stunning innings for Trinidad and it was during the 2009 Champions League T20 that he grabbed attention of billions around the world with a 18-ball 54 for Trinidad and Tobago. He then went on to sign for Mumbai in the Indian T20 League in 2010. He scored his maiden ODI century against India in 2011 in Chennai but unfortunately it ended up in a losing cause.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHis impact on T20 elevated his status in this format and in the inaugural season of the Caribbean Premier League, he was made captain of the Barbados side where the team did fairly well. Since then, he has produced moments of brilliance sporadically for West Indies but has been consistently doing well for Mumbai in the Indian T20 League. An injury forced him to miss the ICC WT20 in Bangladesh in 2014 but his credentials in the shortest format of the game were enough for him to be retained by the Mumbai franchise for the 2014 edition of the Indian T20 League. He continued to be a vital member of the Mumbai unit while his international career was mostly on and off.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nFollowing a disappointing performance at the World Cup and thereafter a complete whitewash against India, Cricket West Indies (CWI) decided to sack Jason Holder and Carlos Brathwaite as skippers of ODI and T20I teams and named Kieron Pollard as captain in limited-overs cricket. The kind of success that Kieron has enjoyed in CPL as a captain is something West Indies would be expecting from him at the international stage.</p>",

Lauded for his agility behind the stumps during that series, Ramdin did his reputation no harm with a 71 against Australia 'Down Under', followed by a fighting 62* against India. He made it to the 2007 ICC World Cup squad despite enduring a miserable 2006-07 season.

At Jamaica, he grew in stature and just 11 months later, he played his first ODI for the West Indies and consequently made his Test debut six months later. But he succumbed to pressure and after being offered several chances, was dropped. Gayle, however, redeemed himself in 2002 with a double century against New Zealand which was followed by a fantastic away series in India thereby sealing his place in the side. His 317 against South Africa in 2005 was breath-taking and his 2006 Champions Trophy performance provided an icing on the cake. He was offered captaincy in 2007 and the Jamaican did reasonably well with a relatively weak West Indian team at his disposal. In 2009, Gayle displayed two extremely contrasting sides of his personality, scoring an unbeaten 165 in a Test against Australia that took more than seven hours, while smashing the fifth fastest Test century off just 70 balls, in the next match. He followed it up with a triple hundred against Sri Lanka next year, becoming only the fourth batsman to score two triple tons in Tests.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGayle was drafted in for Dirk Nannes as a mid-season replacement for Bangalore in the Indian T20 League under controversial circumstances but since then, he has been the undisputed king of Twenty20. The mighty Jamaican became an element of surprise as he single-handedly guided his team all the way to finals. He carried his form in the next edition, once again proving to be an unstoppable force. In the sixth season, 'Gaylestorm' as he is fondly known, smashed the fastest T20 century in the world against Pune off just 30 balls, a record, which only his firepower could pull off. There was no surprise when Bangalore named him as one of the retained players for 2014, the 7th season.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the hardest hitters of the cricket ball in the modern game, Gayle is known to put opposition bowlers under pressure with his no-holds-barred style of batting. Most dangerous on the off side, Gayle's style is not exactly copy book but he still has a technique which is quite effective. His darting off spinners has also proved handy in ODIs and at a time when West Indies have failed to produce even decent batsmen, Gayle is naturally a silver lining. His form, especially in ODIs between 2012 and 2013 dipped to a great extent but given his destructive nature, he should bounce back soon enough.</p>",

Starting with Lahore in Pakistan, to Titans in South Africa, he also went on to play for the English counties of Middlesex, Yorkshire, Warwickshire, Staffordshire and Hampshire.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThroughout his career, Tahir, a leg break bowler, made sporadic appearances for each of these teams which alone suggested that he failed to stick to one place for a longer time and did not live up to his own potential. However, his first-class record was impressive and that earned him a call-up to South Africa's Test squad for their home series against England in 2010. But, on the same day, the decision to include him in the side was overturned as it was found that Tahir was not eligible to play for South Africa at that point of time.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe Pakistan-born Tahir, however, continued to impress at the domestic level for Dolphins. He was finally granted South African citizenship in 2011, before being picked for the ODIs against India, albeit he did not play a single game. Tahir made his ODI debut against West Indies in the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup and immediately shot to fame with his crafty leg-spin which helped him conjure figures of 4 for 41. The juggernaut continued as he scalped 14 wickets from five matches before a thumb fracture ruled him out of the tournament. However, a Test debut came later in the year against Australia, and he had a decent start to it before he endured one of the worst phases of his cricketing career in Adelaide. He was taken to the cleaners by the Australian batsmen and ended up with the worst bowling figures in the history of Test cricket - 0/260. He was dropped after that and was replaced by Robin Peterson.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nNearly a year later, a determined Tahir made his comeback in a grand manner with his maiden Test five-wicket haul against Pakistan in Dubai. He ended up with eight wickets in the match and helped South Africa level the two-match series 1-1. Fame was, however, short-lived as Tahir couldn't trouble the touring Indians even a wee bit and was attacked by them in the first Test in Johannesburg.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nImran Tahir proved his credentials in the 2015 ICC World Cup. In a tournament believed to be for the pacers, he ended up with 15 scalps at an average of 21.53. Having known to turn his googly more than his leg spin, Tahir can become an even better bowler if he adds this one dimension to his style of bowling.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nMore recently though, Tahir has found a new love for the limited-over formats of the game. He has been terrific in the shortest version for the national side as well as his franchise in various T20 Leagues. In 2018, he was selected in the Chennai team for the Indian T20 League and was a massive performer for them in the two editions in 2018 and 2019, firstly as champions and then as runners-up respectively.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThus, Imran will always be one of the premium spinners that South Africa has produced.

        "description": "<p>A talented left-handed batsman, who is a wicket-keeper too, Nicholas was picked in the Trinidad squad for the Champions League T20 tournament in 2013 but could not make much of an impact. It was in 2014 that he came into spotlight with a knock of 143 runs off just 160 balls to take West Indies from 70 for 8 to 208 in the Under-19 World Cup. A fan of MS Dhoni, Pooran thrives under pressure and loves to unleash the big hits.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAs inspiring as it might sound, Pooran had to go through a lot of struggle to even be playing cricket. In January 2015, he was involved in a horrific accident which almost ended his cricket career. He had ruptured his left patellar tendon and fractured his right ankle. He recovered thanks to two surgeries and able guidance by Kieron Pollard but coming back to cricket still wasn't easy. His eagerness to get back on the field was responded with caution by the TTCB board who would not select him until he recovered fully. He left Trinidad & Tobago for Queen's Park CC where he found an able leader in the then West Indies coach Phil Simmons.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn 2016, he was a part of the Pollard-led Barbados side in the domestic T20 competition and struck a 12-ball 33 against T&T. He finished the season with 217 runs in eight innings, including a match winning 81 off 39 against St. Lucia. He was picked for the West Indies' tour of UAE in 2016 to face Pakistan but had a poor run - 25 runs in three T20I matches.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nPooran though was more than happy to represent his national side than lying on the bed with an injured leg. Robin Singh was the coach at Barbados and his good rapport with him and Pollard helped him earn a contract with Mumbai for the 2017 edition of the Indian T20 League. He remains to be the one to watch out for in the near future.</p>",

Deputizing for the then injured Kumble against a visiting Australia side in 2008, his figures of 5-71 led India to one of two Test wins to lift the Border-Gavaskar trophy. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFive years before his first Test, Mishra debuted in ODIs in 2003 against South Africa. Later, recognition arrived after impressive displays in the Indian T20 League for his home city, Delhi and Hyderabad later. A well-disguised googly and a precision leg-break are Mishra's honed stock deliveries.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollowing Kumble's retirement from Tests, Mishra became the first choice to partner Harbhajan whenever selectors opted for a two-pronged spin attack. Like his off-break partner, Mishra too is a handy tail-ender with the technical ability to become a good bowling all-rounder. Mishra has been provided with many opportunities to establish himself in both the shorter formats and the long ones, but unfortunately, he hasn't grabbed them at the big stages until the recent World T20 held in Bangladesh. Mishra managed to pick up 10 wickets in 6 matches in that tournament. He was even declared the man of the match in two consecutive matches for his brilliant bowling performance.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAmit Mishra always has been a prolific wickettaker in the domestic circuit while his performance with the ball in the Indian T20 League has earned him the tag of one of the best spinners in the league. However, his international show has always been hot and cold. The rise of Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja has put extra pressure on him and he always finds himself in and out of the national team. Although, he still remains the best leg spinner in the country.</p>",

His domestic performances led to a bidding war for him during the 2018 Indian T20 League auction where he eventually was bought by the Bengaluru franchise for a whopping 3 crores. After going unused in that edition, Saini turned up for Bangalore in 2019 and was the second most successful bowler for them.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nSeeing his destructive pace and swing with the red ball in the domestic circuit, Saini was included in India's Test squad for their one-off match against Afghanistan.

He was subsequently selected in the 15-man squad. The seven games he played in the tournament did not help him transpire his talent into performance as he managed to surpass 50 just once.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2008, du Plessis was given a six-month contract with Lancashire after impressing the board with good performances in local tournaments. He was known as one of the best fielders in county cricket, vouched by Lancashire coach Mike Watkinson. South Africa were in danger of losing another talented cricketer to England but a strong show in the 2010 domestic season was rewarded with a call-up against India in early 2011.<br />\r\n<br />\r\ndu Plessis, who was hardly known in India, took everyone by surprise when he was signed by Chennai for the inaugural season of the Indian Premier League, ahead of experienced cricketing stars like Brian Lara, Sourav Ganguly and Chris Gayle. The South African had a good first season with the franchise and in 2012, was one of the most successful run-scorers for the team. The team had enough faith to retain him for the following two seasons as well. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, a dream Test debut awaited the talented batsman later that year against the dangerous Aussies which brought him success in his first taste of the longest format of the game. du Plessis was named in South Africa's Test squad, but wasn't included in the playing eleven for the first Test. Fortunately for him, JP Duminy was ruled out due to injury and that paved the way for his debut. du Plessis showed tremendous temperament and grit as he scored a patient fifty in the first innings, followed by a gutsy maiden Test ton in the second that helped the Proteas salvage a highly unlikely draw against Australia. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2013, the Protea was handed full-time T20I captaincy after being the stand-in skipper for AB de Villiers in a few games.<br />\r\nIn the Test series against Pakistan in the UAE, du Plessis was found guilty of tampering the ball, rubbing it against the zip on the pocket of his trousers. He received criticism from many around the world, but his South African team-mates stood by him, claiming that none of the acts he was reprimanded for, were intentional.</p>",

Consequently, he was given his chance in the Lankan A side that toured England in 2011. Prasanna did not fail to impress, as he picked a six-wicket haul that was immediately noticed by the selectors, who then fast-tracked him into the national side for the remaining ODIs against Australia in the same year. His Test debut followed in the same series. He however went wicket-less in the only Test that he played and subsequently was dropped from the Test squad.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2012, he was signed by Uva Next for the inaugural Sri Lankan Premier League, and was also a part of the Champions League T20.

Despite a poor outing in his first match, he was included in the side for the inaugural Champions League T20 that was held in India in 2009. However, his breakthrough moment came in the 2011 edition of the Champions League where he performed brilliantly to scalp ten wickets at 10.50 with an economy rate of just 4.37. He was finally rewarded with an ODI cap in 2011 against India in Ahmedabad and he performed decently on debut with figures of 2/34 from 10 overs.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nNarine's high-arm bowling action is deceptive for batsmen, and with all the variations he possesses, he more often than not succeeds in bamboozling batsmen. The mystery spinner was signed up by Kolkata for the fifth edition of the Indian T20 League in 2012 and he did extremely well in the tournament, ending up as the second highest wicket-taker with 24 wickets, helping Kolkata win the title. Narine was one of just the two players that Kolkata retained ahead of the 2014 auction.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nPlaying in the Indian T20 League was a huge learning experience for him and it also helped him fetch his Test cap, as he was quickly called up for Windies' third Test against England, replacing injured Kemar Roach. He had a decent start to his Test career as he scalped a five-for in just his second Test match while playing against New Zealand in Antigua and was named the Man of the Match with 8 wickets in the match. He endured a tough time on the 2012 Bangladesh tour and was dropped from the Test side.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe offie came into serious trouble with his delivery action in the Champions League Twenty20 2014. He was reported for a suspect bowling action in two consecutive matches and later was banned from playing the final in Bangalore. He was also removed from the Windies squad, who were going to take on India in a tour of five ODIs and a T20 in October later that year. Narine then pulled out his name from the 2015 World Cup squad to work on his bowling action.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nNarine was nowhere in the international circuit for almost a year, but then he made a comeback to the Windies side in November 2015 but again got into trouble with his action. This time around it was the ICC who handed him a suspension in the international format. He ranked No. 1 in the T20I bowling list when he got picked for the 2016 World T20 but he opted out of the tournament to focus on his rehabilitation. After the World Cup in April 2016, ICC cleared his bowling action and he was allowed to participate in the Indian T20 League.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nSunil Narine has been in and out of the national team but continues to be a key member of the Kolkata franchise, both in the Indian T20 League and the Caribbean Premier League.</p>",

He made his Test debut as a 21-year old against in the year 2015 but couldn't replicate his domestic form.  In 2016, he made his white-ball debut against Sri Lanka in the ODI tri-series involving Zimbabwe. In just his second ODI appearance, he scored his maiden ODI century against Zimbabwe.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nWhen West Indies toured England in the year 2017, Hope was all over the record books. He helped his team beat England for the first time since 2000 and also became the first player in 127 years to score centuries in each innings at Headingley, Leeds.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nShai established himself as the key member of the Test and ODI squads and in the year 2019, he along with John Campbell stitched the highest opening partnership of 365 runs in an ODI against Ireland. In that same series, he became the fastest West Indian to score 2000 runs in just 47 innings.  </p>",

A knock of 151 against the Railways and two half centuries were witness to his prowess as an opening batsman.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChand has been an integral part of the India Under-19 team and his consistent performances have often helped the team's cause. He became the youngest player to have played in the IPL, when he was signed by the Delhi Daredevils for the fourth season at the tender age of 17. In 2012, Chand was selected to captain the Under 19 team for the quadrangular series in Australia and he did a good job as India won that tournament with the skipper scoring an unbeaten hundred in the final. His inspirational captaincy also guided the team to success in the Under-19 Asia Cup, where the right-hander was in the form of his life, scoring two consecutive centuries in semi-finals as well as the final. The final however, ended in a thrilling tie against arch rivals Pakistan.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe youngsters purple patch continued later in the year, when the Indian Under-19 team won the Under-19 World Cup in Australia beating defending champions, Australia under his responsible captaincy. Once again, it was the skipper who led from the front, scoring an unbeaten century to guide his team home. After the World Cup, it hasn't been the best of runs for the youngster. He does play for Delhi Ranji team but hasn't had the 'career-changing' season yet. He was bought by Rajasthan for Rs. 65 lakhs in the seventh season of the Indian T20 League. He will gain tremendous knowledge and experience in the company of Rahul Dravid, Shane Watson, Ajinkya Rahane and Brad Hodge.</p>",

In just seven games, the youngster scored 594 runs at an average of 50-plus, along with 33 wickets at an impressive 18.09 average. Further, he was quickly drafted in the India A squad to face the mighty Australians in a warm-up game. The talented all-rounder had no reason to disappoint, as he claimed a seven-wicket haul to dismantle the Aussie batting attack. Immediately after his success with the A team, Rasool was signed up by the IPL franchise Pune for the tournament's sixth edition, thus making him the first player from his state to do so. Rasool made history by becoming the first ever player from Jammu and Kashmir to be included in the national squad for the Zimbabwe series in 2013. Rasool will be playing for the Hyderabad franchise in the seventh edition of the India T20 League. He was bought by them for 95 lakh in the 2014 player’s auction. He has been in some scintillating form in buildup to the 2014 Indian T20 League. He recently scored 139 runs and took 5 wickets in a domestic tournament.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Parthiv Patel is one of the many wicket-keepers India utilized before Mahendra Singh Dhoni came to prominence. In his brief tenure with the Indian cricket team that began in 2002-03, Patel played some commendable knocks against some of the best bowling line-ups despite his petite frame. His glove work was splendid, but lacked consistency. He never achieved the same success as Dhoni and so returned unceremoniously to the domestic league.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHowever, just when you thought you’d seen the last of this young lad, Patel's willow started scripting a comeback of its own in 2007. Four consecutive centuries in the first-class circuit against national teams put him into the limelight once again, and he was signed by Chennai in 2008 for the Indian T20 league. After three successful seasons there, he was auctioned to Kerala in 2011, where he was named skipper after the departure of Mahela Jayawardena.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nParthiv was then bought by Hyderabad in 2012 for the fifth edition of the Indian T20 league. Along with Shikhar Dhawan, Parthiv was consistent at the top of the order in that outfit. Bangalore took note of that and grabbed him for the seventh season in 2014. He didn't have a great time and was acquired by Mumbai for the eighth edition of the Indian T20 League. Patel struck form in the second half of the tournament where he hit 339 runs to finish as Mumbai's 4th highest run-getter in their victorious 2015 campaign.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHis good run continued as he led Gujarat to their maiden Vijay Hazare Trophy title, scoring his maiden List A ton. Runs continued to flow off his bat as he registered four fifties in nine Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy games and followed it up with a century against India A in Deodhar Trophy. It was in 2016, four years since he last played for the national team, he received a shock call-up for India for the third Test against England in place of injured Wriddhiman Saha. He responded well to the call with a brisk fifty and a career-best 71, opening the batting. He was also the highest run-getter for Mumbai in their victorious Indian T20 League campaign in 2017. Parthiv Patel has certainly given his career an opening here but continues his struggle for a spot in the main team.</p>",

Known to be an aggressive batsman, Tiwary idolises English cricketer Kevin Pietersen and prefers the front foot more for his cricketing shots. With a minimalistic approach towards his batting, he goes charging down the pitch keeping in mind the intention of getting as many runs as possible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the domestic front, he came into the limelight with three scores of 150-plus runs, the most memorable being his match-winning knock of 151 not out that gave his team victory over Karnataka in the Ranji Super League semis of 2006-07. He averaged 99.50 then and that took his overall first-class average to 57.50. At 21, he led Bengal to a Cooch Behar Trophy triumph and also captained the state Twenty20 side. Tiwary was drafted in the Indian team for the ODI series against Bangladesh in 2007 but did not play a single game. He made his ODI debut in 2008 against Australia on their soil but it wasn’t a memorable one as he got out on 2.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2008, Tiwary was bought by Delhi for the inaugural Indian T20 season but was later auctioned to Kolkata in 2010. However, luck was on his side in 2011, when an injury to Rohit Sharma on the England tour fetched him another international call-up in the ODI squad. Later that year, Tiwary scored his maiden ODI hundred against the West Indies, and retired not out. After spending more than six months on the benches following that stupendous century, he was included in the side for the ODI series against Sri Lanka. The youngster did justice to his inclusion by displaying an all-round performance in the series. He was then named in the T20I squad for the 2012 World Twenty20 but failed to make it to the playing 11. Tiwary was also selected for the lone T20 against South Africa which was played celebrating 150 years of settlement of Indians in South Africa.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHis biggest moment however, came in 2012, in the fifth edition of the Indian T20 League where hit the winning runs for Kolkata against Chennai for the title. Tiwary had a dismal 2013 season with injuries once again and was on the sidelines for majority of the time. In 2014, he was drafted in by the Delhi franchise for the seventh edition of the League.</p>",

It was followed by a dream first-class debut against West Indies A, where he accounted for more than half of the West Indies wickets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith figures of 4-41 in an innings of an Irani Trophy game against Mumbai, he put himself firmly in contention for an inclusion in the Test squad. A month later, Unadkat was included in India's Test side for the tour of South Africa, where he made his international debut. With an enviable height of 6 feet 3 inches, the tall, left-arm medium pacer can land the ball on seam and swing with variety as well. His ability as an aggressive fielder is an added asset. In 2013, he was one of the top players bought by the Bangalore for the sixth edition of the Indian T20 League. In 2014, he was bought by the Delhi franchise for 2.8 crores.</p>",

After emerging as the highest run-getter in domestic cricket's premier T20 tournament, the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, he came back in the reckoning. However, destiny had some other ideas for him.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAt the day of the 2017 Indian T20 League auction, a fake media report circulated his name in the social media. It pointed out that he is in police custody due to a drink and drive case. As a result, he was ignored at the auction. His identity got mixed up with Harmeet Singh, a left-arm spin bowler. Later the news was corrected but the damage was already done. He got a redemption later on as Bangalore drafted him in to replace the injured Sarfaraz Khan. Due to the batting heavy line-up, he didn't get a look in though. Harpreet will look forward to impress the selectors by performing consistently at the domestic level.</p>",

Though he was sidelined in a few matches, his side had belief in his abilities. In the 2014 season, his franchise bid aggressively for him to ward off the competition. He played some handy knocks lower done the order to repay their faith. His prolific run scoring in the 2013-14 Ranji season was the reason he came into the limelight. He scored 1223 runs in 11 games and emerged as the top run-getter in the entire season.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThough he performed consistently at the domestic level, a national call-up eluded him. He kept on pushing for a place and eventually, he was rewarded. He made his ODI debut against Sri Lanka in November, 2015. After that, India sent a second string side to Zimbabwe for a 3-match ODI series and that is where he flourished. He scored a brilliant unbeaten century to help India's cause. To follow it up, he was even more impressive against England at his home ground, Pune. His lightning 120 off 76 balls thoroughly impressed the cricket lovers  and helped him cement his place in the regular middle order. Apart from being a bright prospect with the bat, he is a decent part-time off spinner as well and is often considered to have the golden-arm.

His ability to adapt to tricky situations and surfaces has made him one of the batting mainstays of the team.

Since then, he hasn't had to look back with impressive performances coming in the following years as well.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nFrom 2013-15, his batting went to another level as he amassed runs at will, often saving his side from difficult situations against tough opponents. While his FC record has been impressive, Bawne worked on his limited-overs skills too and it paid rich dividends in the 2014-15 Vijay Hazare Trophy where he shone bright. His strike-rate is low for 50-over matches but has shown progress in that area while contributing consistently with the bat. His promising talent fetched him a contract with Delhi for the 2017 Indian T20 League season. Although not a player with flair, his temperament could help him succeed if and when he gets a chance for his franchise. </p>",

He made his ODI debut in 2015 against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo. The young Afghan leggie didn't take long to make an impression and soon was ruling the roost among the Associate Nations, especially in the shortest version of the game.

The leggie tumbled many records on his path to success and his 7-wicket haul in an ODI match against West Indies made him the first Associate nation cricketer to achieve this feat. In 2018, ICC named him the Associate Cricketer of the Year and there was no stopping this Afghan tsunami.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nFollowing his success in the Indian T20 League, Rashid signed up with Guyana Amazon Warriors in the CPL and also took the first hat-trick of this tournament.

The outstanding performance of Rashid Khan coincided with the great success of Afghanistan at the Associate level and soon ICC promoted them to Full Membership and granted them the Test status.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nExpectations were quite high from Rashid Khan in the 2019 Cricket World Cup but the Afghan star disappointed and it reflected in the ordinary performance of Afghanistan. But the selectors showed great belief in Rashid's potential and immediately after the mega event, the 20-year-old leg-spinner was handed over the captaincy across all formats of the game.  </p>",

He scored his maiden ODI ton against Pakistan in November 2015, while he also had an amazing series against Sri Lanka where he scored two big hundreds and had an average above 100. Jason Roy, along with Alex Hales and Jonny Bairstow showed how much England's approach to the limited-overs format has changed over the past 4 years.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nJason Roy was always going to be one of the first names on the team-sheet for England in the 2019 World Cup and he proved to be a huge hit in the tournament. He scored a total of 443 runs in the 8 matches that he played with an average of 63.28 as England won the tournament and lifted their maiden World Cup trophy after a long wait. Owing to his strong ODI form, the English team management decided to try him in the longer version of the game as well and included him in the 2019 Ashes squad.</p>",

The wicketkeeper-batsman started young, playing for Yorkshire Under-15s and later representing England Under-17s. He went on to have a prolific season with Yorkshire's second eleven, before eventually making his First-Class debut against Somerset in 2009. Impressive performances saw him being picked in the Lions squad for their tour to the West Indies in early 2011. Later that year, he was included in England's ODI squad for their series against Ireland, with the selectors clearly grooming a specialist batsman for the future. But he did not play there and made his ODI debut directly in the home series against India in 2011. His scintillating knock of 41 off 21 balls in the fifth ODI helped England complete a 3-0 series win over India. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBairstow then traveled with the squad to India in the same year, hoping that he would be given another chance to play. It happened, thanks to a hundred that he scored in their warm-up game against Hyderabad, which ultimately saw him replacing the experienced Ian Bell in the ODI side. The following year, he was given his Test cap in the home series against West Indies. He showed signs of early maturity when he came out against a lethal South African pace attack in the Lord's Test and scored a gutsy 95, replacing Kevin Pietersen at the No.4 position. A fifty in the second innings stamped his authority in the middle order. Later in 2012, he was included in Yorkshire's T20 squad ahead of the Champions League T20 in South Africa but couldn't play due to an injury. Bairstow had his chances during England's 3-0 drubbing of Australia in the 2013 Ashes at home but failed to make any impact and struggled to find a regular Test spot. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA return to county and a change in technique - holding the bat way up alongside him - saw him sore back amongst runs. He had a dream 2015 with Yorkshire, scoring as many as 1108 First-Class runs at 92.33. Bairstow faced stiff competition from Jos Buttler but the latter's slump in form saw him return to the Test team in 2016. Jonny didn't let the selectors down as he racked up most runs in a calendar year for a keeper and finished in the top two overall. Along with it, he also effected the highest number of dismissals in a calendar year for a keeper. In him, England found a stable middle order batsman who showed tremendous application irrespective of conditions and became one of the mainstays for them.</p>",

A lethal in-swinger that unsettles the very best, Broad's wicket-to-wicket dictation made him one of England's leading strike bowlers since his debut in 2007. Occasional opening for county Leicestershire also sculptured Broad into a reliable left-handed tail-ender. One of Broad's worst nightmares on the cricket field, or rather any bowler's nightmare, was when he was spanked for 6 sixes in an over by Yuvraj Singh in the inaugural edition of the ICC World Twenty20.</p>\r\n<p>After his first rub of the green in 2007 in Sri Lanka, Broad's inability to contain often saw him go for runs, in return for an odd wicket or two. His first five-fer came against the Windies at Kingston in 2009, the year that saw him rise to prominence. Later that year, Broad's two five-wicket hauls against Australia saw him on the brink of permanency in the England attack. Broad's comfort in batting was proven when in the longest format, he scored a career best 169 in an epic 332-run stand for the eight wicket against Pakistan at Lord's in 2010. In the Indian T20 league, he was picked by Mohali in 2011 but couldn't get a game and injury ruled him out of the 2012 season. 'Broady' continued to be England's first-change option in travels to South Africa and Bangladesh. Being one of the more experienced T20 players with a debut in 2006, he was an integral part of England's World T20 success in West Indies in 2010. Later, in mid-2011, Broad was named the captain of the T20 side however he failed to impress and was replaced by Eoin Morgan. In 2012 though, Broad was in fine form in whites for England and was a major orchestrator of England's Ashes victory at home in the following year. Although England were battered 5-0 in the return Ashes later in the same year, Broad was by far, the best English bowler on display.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBroad helped his team return the favour with one of the most devastating spells of 8 for 15 at Nottingham in Ashes at home. Leading the attack, he notched up 21 wickets at 20.90 to help England beat Australia 3-2 in 2015. He also played his 100th Test on England's tour of India 2016.</p>",

Two years later in 2008, his best came to the fore in the domestic circuit where he took 42 wickets at an average of 20.57.

He had a wonderful 2011, piling heaps of runs and taking wickets at the same time. A brilliant hundred with five sixes in an over against Hampshire, and a month later a maiden limited-overs ton proved his mettle on the domestic front. However, Stokes was struck by a broken finger injury, but he continued to play for the England Lions. He was then called up for England's ODI series against Ireland later that year. He made his debut against them in August 2011. He also made his T20I debut the same year in September against the Windies.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nConsistently in contention for the shorter formats for England, Stokes was selected in the England Test side for the Ashes Down Under, in 2013. Luck turned towards Stokes when Jonathan Trott was forced to return home due to stress-related illness after the first Test at the 'Gabba'. Stokes was handed his first cap as his replacement in the second Test at the Adelaide Oval. The cricketing fraternity saw what Stokes was made of in the third Test at the WACA where he scored his maiden Test ton while all the other English batsmen struggled. In the Sydney Test, he picked up his maiden 5-fer, taking six Aussie wickets albeit in a losing cause. Stokes was the silver lining in what was a disastrous series for England.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nStokes did not have a good 2014 as he struggled for form and consistency throughout the year and was eventually replaced for some time by either Chris Woakes or Chris Jordan. He also missed out on the World Cup squad of 2015 as a result of his form. The tournament ended disastrously for England but that failure embarked the nation to change their playing style and the 'New England' project was set in motion. The plan was to play fearless attacking cricket and Stokes has been a major component of that project.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe first major moment of Stokes' international career came when he retained his place in the England squad for the first Test against New Zealand at Lord's in 2015. After scoring 92 runs in the first innings, Stokes recorded the fastest ever Test century at Lord's and second fastest by an English batsman, taking just 85 deliveries to bring up his hundred. It was just the kick-start that his career required. He played another world-class innings in a Test match against South Africa. He came at the crease with England at 167/4 and went on to score the second fastest double century in Tests, off just 163 balls. He formed a 6th wicket partnership of 399 runs with Jonny Bairstow who himself scored unbeaten 150 runs. That series was huge for him in terms of his place in the team and he became permanent in the XI.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn 2016, Stokes hit rock-bottom in his cricketing career. England reached the final of the 2016 T20I World Cup which was held in India. England was in pole position to win the cup with 19 runs required off the final over for West Indies to win and Stokes was handed the ball to defend the total. He ended up conceding four consecutive sixes off the first four balls and England were denied the trophy in the most heart-crushing fashion. However, another setback was to follow in Stokes' career in 2017. In the month of September, Stokes got involved in a controversy created by his actions. After celebrating an ODI victory in Bristol, Ben got into a fist-fight with two people outside a bar along with teammate Alex Hales. It damaged his reputation a lot as a player and he was omitted from the Ashes 2017-18 tour where England was humiliated 4-0. He was also charged with a suspension of 8 matches but the decision was later overturned by the Bristol Magistrates' Court.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nBen Stokes finally had his moment in the sun when the 2019 World Cup came calling. The all-rounder showed immense form and contributed superbly with both bat and ball. The defining moment though was the World Cup final where Stokes scored unbeaten 84 runs to take his side to the Super Over where he hit 8 runs off 3 balls. He was chosen the Player of the Final but more importantly, he received the adulation from the world that a player like him deserved. Soon after that, Ben was rewarded for his maturity and was named the deputy to Joe Root for the 2019 Ashes.</p>",

He has big boots to fill in after the retirement of Shane Watson and hasn't disappointed so far. The Australians will hope that he graduates into a top quality batsman. </p>",

        "description": "<p>Unorthodox Irish batsman Eoin Morgan’s achievements will forever seem tainted by his switch to lucrative England to represent the Three Lions in international cricket.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAfter successful youth stints for Middlesex, Morgan made his ODI debut for Ireland in 2006 against Scotland but then switched to England ahead of the 2009 World Twenty20. He played his first game in English colours in 2009 against the West Indies in Bristol. An extended opportunity came in the 7-match ODI series at home against Australia, where he featured on six occasions with top-scores of 43 and 58, showcasing a penchant for the reverse sweep. He later represented England in the World Twenty20, playing a solitary game against the Netherlands. He continued to perform well in both formats, with ODI centuries against Bangladesh and Australia in 2010. The left-hander’s ability to finish an innings drew comparisons to Australian Michael Bevan.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAfter playing a crucial role in England’s World T20 success in 2010, Morgan was given his premier Test cap against touring Bangladesh. He retained his place to face Pakistan a month later, where he also scored his maiden Test hundred. Later, in 2011, he was appointed as Stuart Broad’s deputy in the T20 format. While many may doubt Moggie’s loyalty for turning against his home country, delving into a professional’s need to challenge himself with and against the best in the business, may render those doubts harsh.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nWith the sacking of Alastair Cook as the ODI captain close to the 2015 World Cup, the selectors trusted Eoin Morgan to take over and do the job. Eoin started well in the tri-series in Australia, involving the home team and India, but in spite of his individual good form, his team failed to win the final. England's misery didn't end there as they experienced a very poor World Cup where they won just two matches (against Scotland and Afghanistan) and failed to qualify for the quarter-final.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nPost the 2015 World Cup debacle, Eoin Morgan decided to build a team with a fearless attitude. Many senior players were dropped and the team management invested in some young talents. Soon the results started to show and 'New England' under the able leadership of Eoin Morgan began to evolve. The revival was dramatic, to say the least, and in 2018 the Three Lions leapfrogged India to top World ODI Rankings for the first time in five years.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nKnown for his composure under pressure, Morgan earned the respect and confidence of his players. He gave the license to his boys to fearlessly express themselves and that fresh approach changed everything for the English cricket as far as the shorter versions of the game is concerned. From down in the dumps in 2015, England entered the 2019 Cricket World Cup as one of the favourites and that was the testament of Morgan's inspirational captaincy.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nEoin never let captaincy affect his batting. In fact, his batting average improved by leaps and bounds after taking over the reins. His ability as a batsman was never under doubt and his presence in the middle order allowed the top order to bat freely. In one of his knocks in the 2019 World Cup, Morgan smashed a 71-ball 148 against Afghanistan which included 17 sixes - a world record. </p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>Under Morgan's guidance and 'play fire with fire' approach, England scripted history by winning their maiden ODI World Cup title in 2019 and ended the 44-year long wait of a country that invented this beautiful game of cricket.</p>",

Since then, he was a regular headline in England’s domestic circuit. With a fair amount of first-class experience, he was then added to the national squad for Test series in India, followed by a tour to the West Indies.

However, his poor form continued in Tests and soon he was dropped for the series against Sri Lanka in the UAE. He has sparkled sporadically in the ODIs and T20Is. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHis flamboyance, immaculate timing and wide range of shots in his armoury make him a dangerous proposition for any opposition but with the kind of talent he possesses, it's high time he starts being consistent!</p>",

        "description": "<p>Since his inception in cricket at a very young age, Brendan Taylor over the years has grown leaps and bounds to become one of Zimbabwe's premier batsmen and has also made a name for himself as his team's crisis man, having pulled off several games single-handedly.</p>\r\n<p>Taylor, who made his domestic debut for Mashonaland A when he was just 15, showed early glimpses of his talent when he scored 200 not out in the B division of a Logan Cup game and also went on to play in two Under-19 World Cups. However, in 2004, with a mass exodus of Zimbabwe's leading players, in a desperate move, the selectors gave Taylor the go ahead despite his inability to come up with consistent performances in domestic cricket. A string of low scores followed but the right-hander finally came good in the final game of his debut ODI series against Sri Lanka with a top score of 74. He retained his place in the subsequent Test series and went on to score a half century in his second Test. 2004-05 proved to be the turning point in his career as he scored a first class century on the tour to Pakistan and also enjoyed a fine run in the domestic circuit. Few off-field discretions saw him dropped from the team mid-2005, but selectors couldn't ignore his batting talents for long and just months later, he was back in the Test side.</p>\r\n<p>Following the temporary departure of the then captain Taibu, Taylor donned the wicket keeping gloves and with the pressure of being a specialist batsman no longer present, began to go from strength to strength. In an ODI against Bangladesh in August 2006, with 5 needed off the last ball, Taylor managed to pull off a humungous six, guiding Zimbabwe to a miraculous win. But it wasn't to be the last gem he played, as his unbeaten 60 in the 2007 T20 World Cup also earned Zimbabwe a famous win over Australia. He hit his first international century against Bangladesh in ODIs in 2009. Often criticized for not converting starts, unbeaten centuries against South Africa and Sri Lanka in 2010 gave clear indications that the right-hander had turned the tables. Brendan Taylor was the lone shining star of Zimbabwe's dismal campaign in the 2011 World Cup and he was rewarded with captaincy in June 2011 ahead of the team's return to Test cricket. He started off with a bang as a skipper as he scored his first Test century against Bangladesh in Harare.</p>\r\n<p>The juggernaut continued as he ended the home ODI series against New Zealand as the highest run-getter which included back to back centuries in Harare. He became the first Zimbabwean to hit back-to-back ODI centuries. Though the hosts lost both the matches, Taylor played a gem of 75 off 65 balls in the third to set the platform and help Zimbabwe pull one back in the three-match series. Taylor was named the Man of the Series. He topped the batting charts in his next home series against Bangladesh, including two centuries. The tall right-hander has been the lynchpin of this Zimbabwean batting line-up, with his front foot cover drives and his astute uppercuts a sight to behold. Taylor has been performing very well in the T20 format as well especially in the Bangladesh T20 league, where he was the 3rd highest run getter. Due to this performance, Hyderabad franchise picked him up for the 2014 edition of the Indian T20 League.</p>\r\n<p>The 2015 ICC World Cup was Taylor's swansong and he certainly ended on a high, finishing fourth in the list of leading run-getters of the tournament, at an impressive average of 72.16. Taylor called it quits from international cricket post the mega event.</p>",

A good hitter of the ball and a handy seam bowler, he is a good asset to have in the side.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn the third season of the Indian T20 League (2010), Binny was bought by the Mumbai franchise but later, in 2011, he was signed by the Rajasthan team. After joining them, slowly but surely his game improved. He shone for Karnataka in the 2011-12 season where he emerged as the leading run-scorer for his side. He also earned his first 10-wicket haul in first class cricket during that season. Gradually, he started living to his potential.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn the sixth season (2013) of the Indian T20 League, Binny played some breezy knocks which proved to be vital for his team's cause. He was decent with the ball and sharp in the field as well. He got noticed by the selectors and got a call-up to the national side, although he failed to impress.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nBinny was a part of the second-string side that was sent for the tour of Bangladesh in 2014. In the second of the 3-match ODI series, India were bowled out for a paltry 105. Chasing such a score seemed to be a cakewalk for the Bangla Tigers but Binny had other ideas. He bowled with great control and seam position to absolutely rattle the opposition. His match figures, 4.4-2-4-6 remains the best bowling effort by an Indian in ODIs.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nRajasthan retained him for the seventh season of the Indian T20 League. However, he was a bit below par and didn't do anything significant for his franchise. He kept getting opportunities for his country on and off but failed to cement his spot. In the 2016 season, Bangalore bought him in the auction. He was played on a regular basis but was nowhere near his best. The 2017 season also was disappointing for him as his career hit a roadblock. With plenty of competition in the national team, Binny would have to perform out of his skin if he wants to revive his career at the highest level.</p>",

As ill luck would have it, two games were abandoned due to rain and in the second match he had a nightmare of a debut by scoring a two-ball duck. The next chance for him came in mid-2011 against the West Indies but he failed to impress much in the four ODIs he played with scores of 51, 3, 4 and 11. After that many wrote him off, saying he didn’t have it in him to make it big in international cricket. However, consistent performances at the domestic level helped him keep his place in India’s second tier of players. All he needed was some rub of the green and that came during the 2013 Test series against the visiting Australians.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe out-of-form Virender Sehwag was shown the door for the third Test and Dhawan made his Test debut in Mohali.

In the ICC Champions Trophy in June 2013, he scored two tons in India’s triumph. He once again shone in the 2015 World Cup in Australia where he was India’s highest scorer and played a big role in the team’s semi-final appearance. His career had an up-and-down phase post that but it was once again in an ICC event that he showed that he had it in him.

        "description": "<p>A stocky and athletic player, Robin Uthappa made his debut for the Indian ODI team against England in 2006 on the back of some run mountains in the domestic circuit. He first came to the public eye when he scored a scintillating 66 for India B against the A team boasting of an attack with the likes of Zaheer Khan, RP Singh and Murali Kartik.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUthappa scored so heavily (854 runs in 7 matches) in 2006-2007, that it was impossible to leave him out of the national team. This led to his memorable debut at Indore in 2006, where he transformed this form into a well-made 86 before he was run out. Inconsistency led to his removal from the team, but he was brought back for the 7-match ODI series against England. He played the sixth match with India trailing the series 3-2, and guided the team home to a famous win with an unbeaten 47 off only 33 balls. This secured his place in the team for a while.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUthappa was nicknamed ‘The Walking Assassin’ because of his unique tactic of strolling down the pitch. He is essentially an attacking minded player who loves to score runs quickly. He was included in the team for the 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup in the West Indies, but had a very poor tournament scoring a miserable 30 runs in the three group games. He was never really able to transfer his domestic form to the international scene on a consistent basis. In time, he came to be known more as a limited-overs specialist. Uthappa was instrumental in India’s triumph in the maiden ICC T20 World Cup. In the group match against Pakistan, he walked in to bat with the score at 39/4 and went on to crack his first half century in T20Is. In the same match, he went on to secure the bowl out in India’s favour and is remembered for tipping his cap over and saluting after he had hit the stumps.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUthappa played for the Mumbai in the first season of the Indian T20 league and in the following year, he swapped places with Zaheer Khan to join Bangalore. In the third edition, he bludgeoned 51 runs in only 21 balls, the fastest half century at that time. In 2011, he was picked up by the new franchise, Pune for a whopping 2.1 million USD (approx. 9.4 crores), although he did not quite do justice to this price tag. Uthappa kept playing for Karnataka in the domestic front but was far from being considered for the national team. In the 7th season, he was drafted in to represent the Kolkata franchise.</p>",

As a wicket-keeper batsman looking to be India’s reply to Gilchrist, Karthik had all the ingredients to be a reliable hand in both departments. With the willow, his technical nuance was evident.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nProof of his underlined batting prowess is found in the fact that, even after Dhoni cementing his place as skipper-keeper, Karthik has been recalled as a specialist batsman alone. His batting ability stood the test of challenging pitches in England in 2007 where, as an opener, he recorded fifties in each of the three Tests to aid India in a historic series victory.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nBeyond 2007, Dhoni’s rapid success soon sidelined Karthik. But for his lapse in concentration, the Chennai-born keeper would have made greater waves. As time progressed, selectors looked to hone Karthik’s batting abilities alone and fit him in the interim as a specialist batsman, aside from being Dhoni’s stand-in behind the sticks. Still, his role was limited to playing second fiddle and continuous stop-starts stunted his progress on a personal front, while, along with Parthiv Patel, he became proof of India’s embarrassment of riches in talent behind the stumps. He was picked up by Mumbai for the 5th edition of the Indian T20 league as a specialist wicket-keeper but sent shock-waves in the cricketing world when he was grabbed for a whopping 12.5 crores by the Delhi franchise for the 7th edition of the Indian T20 League.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn-and-out of the national team didn't affect his performance in the domestic circuit where he continued to pile on the runs. After Delhi, Bangalore bought him for a huge sum in 2015, followed by the Gujarat Lions. With plenty of experience behind, DK landed the captaincy of Kolkata in 2018 and he took his team almost to the glory, only to get knocked out in Qualifier 2.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIt turned out to be a fruitful 2018 for Karthik as he once again got the opportunity to represent India when the selectors decided to rest Dhoni for the Nidahas Trophy. His 8-ball 29 which included a last-ball six in the final led India to the T20 tri-series win and DK staked his claim for the role of a finisher in the team. Considering his experience and composure in pressure situations, Karthik was selected ahead of Rishabh Pant for the second-choice wicket-keeper in India's World Cup squad for 2019.</p>",

His hard work did not go unnoticed and he got a call up to the national side. With Gautam Gambhir banned for elbowing Shane Watson, he made his debut in the fourth and final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nVijay made a confident 33 and 41 on debut. He came across as someone who was aware of his limitations and had a fine balance at the crease. Not afraid to use his feet to the spinners just added to the joy of watching the elegant batsman flow when in mood. However, the return of Gambhir meant that he had to wait for his chance. He played a part in the Bangladesh and South Africa Test series before making his ODI debut against South Africa in 2010.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>Not able to keep up with the run-scoring, Vijay went through a slump before roaring back into the reckoning with a blistering season for Chennai in the Indian T20 League. It was in 2010 that he turned things around. Seen as someone who was a Test specialist, Vijay surprised one and all by his bold and attractive strokeplay. He hit a magnificent century against Rajasthan and was instrumental in Chennai’s twin title wins in 2010 and 2011.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>It was time for Tests now and this time Vijay did not let the chance go by. He smashed 430 runs against Australia with two centuries in the 2013 series. That earned him a recall to the ODI side but he fluffed the chances and was shown the door by the selectors. It was since the tour of South Africa that he managed to come back and stamp his authority in the whites for India. He showed tremendous temperament and patience to play few of India’s best Test knocks away from home.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>His 95 at Lord’s in 2014 was instrumental in India’s win at the venue after 28 years. Vijay scored 402 runs on that tour and was one of the very few positives for India. He made 99 at Adelaide in 2014 and followed it up with a fluent 144 at the Gabba to further prove his credentials as a Test opener.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>Injuries then threatened to hamper his progress but whenever given a chance at the top of the order he made it count. After the 150 against Bangladesh, he chipped in with vital contributions but could not get the big score. He did manage to go past the three-figure mark thrice in the grand home season for India in 2016-17 and remains one of India’s best Test batsmen after the retirement of the Fabulous Four.</p>",

In Moin Khan and Rashid Latif, Kamran Akmal’s much-rotated predecessors, Pakistan too followed the sport-wide trend of specialists behind the stumps with average batting ability. The arrival of Adam Gilchrist bucked the trend, and Kamran became Pakistan’s own wicket-keeper batsman. Still, doubts are often raised over Akmal’s ability with the glove, in contrast to his assured batting prowess. It rightly indicates towards Akmal primarily being a batsman who was later augmented to a glove-man.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInto just his third Test inning during his debut tour to Zimbabwe in 2002, Kamran Akmal notched his first international half-century. Only in early 2005 against West Indies was Akmal’s batting given additional exposure, sent as an opening partner to Imran Nazir to face West Indies. A century ensued, Akmal’s career-first, and growing doubts over his shoddy wicket-keeping were set aside. Constant pressure to perform well with the bat as to find grace with his keeping shortcomings helped Akmal to 5 international tons between November 2005 and January 2006. He played his first World Cup in 2007, in part of Pakistan’s poor showing at the Caribbean.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRiding on that purple patch between late 2005 and early 2006, Akmal’s form deteriorated, in a slump that witnessed only 2 additional centuries in ODI and Tests each from 2006 to mid-2010. But his knack of scoring runs in quick time saw Kamran’s inclusion in the prolific Pakistani T20 side, helping his team to the T20 World Cup win in 2009. During the tournament, improvements were also evident in his keeping evidenced by his 4 stumpings against Netherlands.

        "description": "<p>Tim Paine is an exciting wicket-keeper batsman who has started to find his feet in international cricket. He may not be in the mould of an Adam Gilchrist but the Tasmanian can still pack a punch with a bat in hand and is also a safe bet behind the wickets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven as a youngster, Paine assumed a leadership role and was made captain of the Under-15 and Under-17 Tasmanian teams. He also captained Australia’s Under-19 World Cup team in 2004. He debuted for Tasmania against South Australia in 2005 but his maiden first -class century came against Western Australia, a masterly knock of 215. In 2006-07, he was the highest run-getter in ODIs for Tasmania and also became their first-choice keeper affecting 21 dismissals in the season. Since then, Paine has been acquainted with the task of combining his batting and wicket-keeping. He was then selected to represent the Australia A side against Pakistan A where his performances earned him a call to the national setup. An injury to Brad Haddin marked Paine’s ODI debut against Scotland in 2009 where he scored 29 runs and prized a catch. He also made his T20I debut in a rain affected match against England the same year. Paine was part of Australia’s World Twenty20 squad in 2009 but didn’t get a look in. His Test debut came a year later against Pakistan at the historic Lords’ in which he performed admirably with the gloves.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n‘Kid’ as he is nicknamed, generally opens the batting for Australia in ODIs as opposed to Tasmania where he bats in the lower middle-order. He is more of an orthodox batsman who tries to get settled and then go for the big shots. His wicket keeping skills are also sound though he is not as acrobatic as a Mark Boucher or even Brad Haddin. Paine is expected to fill the void left by Gilchrist as Australia herald in a new generation of cricketers. He was handed over the vice-captaincy of the Twenty20 side in early 2011. He was also bought by Pune Warriors India in the IPL.</p>\r\n<br />",

        "description": "<p>There have been fewer fairytales over the last decade in the cricketing world than Steven Smith’s rise as a premier batsman. After having made his debut across formats in the 2007/08 domestic season as a leg spinner who could bat a bit, Smith found himself constantly in and out of the Australian side. While he always had the ability to the turn the ball appreciably, there were question marks on his consistency as a bowler. Smith made his international debut in 2010 but after the Ashes series defeat at home, he found himself out of the Test side while his limited-overs fortunes weren’t too different.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nInstead of his leg spin, Smith’s batting showed more promise and had plenty of grit – a factor that eventually saw him return to the side as a specialist batsman in 2013. Drafted into the team’s tour of India with senior players dropped, Smith impressed with his patience and adaptability against spin. The performances earned him a place in the Ashes tour of England in the same year. In testing conditions, he was able to hold his own and even registered his maiden Test ton. He continued to be consistent and played vital knocks in Australia regaining the Ashes while also notching a series win in South Africa in 2014.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nRuns kept coming at fairly consistent rate for the young man but it was the home series against India in 2014-15 when Smith made an emphatic statement to the world. Having racked up four centuries in as many Tests, he even made his captaincy debut in the series, filling in for the injured Michael Clarke. After this historical series, Smith established himself as the side’s main Test batsman and hasn’t looked back since, notching up runs in all conditions against tough oppositions. His laudable success eventually saw him being ranked number one in Tests.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe 2015 Ashes tour of England saw him registering two centuries, including a double ton at Lord’s although Australia lost the series. Even as he was dominating bowling attacks, there was a question mark on whether he could replicate the success on swinging pitches and against spinners. His success in England put to rest some doubt although the pundits weren’t exactly convinced. Smith was appointed permanent captain of Australia after the 2015 Ashes series. The runs kept coming for ‘Smudge’ as he is fondly called and the 2016-17 season is what probably cemented his position as the best Test batsman in the world.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nPlaying spin in the sub-continent is no easy task and the Sri Lankan tour in 2016 where the Aussies were blanked 0-3, taught a harsh lesson to him. He fared decently well with a century and a fifty. A bigger challenge beckoned in the summer of 2017 as Australia toured India. Nobody gave his side a chance against a formidable opposition boasting of the top two spinners in the world. However, it was his grinding century and some smart captaincy that helped Australia take a lead in the series and despite eventually losing the decider, they made India fight hard for the victory.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAlthough primarily a fantastic Test batsman, Smith’s exploits have been good in ODIs as well. He notched up fifty-plus scores in his five consecutive innings of the 2015 World Cup, making him the first player to achieve the feat. The 2015-17 phase saw him upping his limited-overs game as well. Light on his feet and very fidgety at the crease, Smith’s movements aren’t a delight to the purists but is very effective. What works in his favor is his impeccable temperament and ability to correct mistakes quickly. He is also blessed with fantastic hand-eye coordination and reflexes which help him to amass runs with an unorthodox technique.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nLike most top players, Smith has also been involved in franchise T20 leagues. He led his home side Sydney to a title in 2011 while also impressing in the Indian T20 League. He even carried out the duties of stand-in captain for a few franchises before being appointed full-time skipper in 2017 for the Pune franchise that eventually finished as runners up.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>His career went downhill after the ball tampering controversy for which he was banned for one year by the board. Steve stayed motivated during that lean period and eventually returned to playing cricket by participating in the 2019 Indian T20 League. Batting form was never an issue for him as he continued to score runs and was later included in the World Cup squad. It was a decent tournament for Smudge where Australia got knocked out in the semis. Soon after that, in the 2019 Ashes in England, Smith announced his return to Test cricket with a bang by scoring an outstanding century under pressure in tough conditions.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>At present, he is arguably among the finest batsmen in world cricket across formats. There is no denying the fact that he will be among the top batsmen of all time by the time he hangs up his boots.</p>",

Stellar performances at home were followed by an incredible South African tour, where he displayed his class in the series that Australia eventually won, taking 12 wickets. His ODI debut followed soon, as he appeared against New Zealand in 2009. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFoot injuries, coupled with shoulder woes resulted in Siddle spending more time off the field, than on field. However, he came back in the team even stronger, posing a threat to the batsmen in the 2009 Ashes, with 29 Test wickets in six matches against the Proteas, at a staggering average of 27.65. With decent displays of his form, Siddle continues to be one of the strike bowlers in the Aussie line-up. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith injuries constantly obstructing his promising career, Siddle decided to stick to a vegetarian diet since 2013. Plenty of doubts were raised on possible effect on stamina but he managed to overcome all hurdles.</p>",

However, he continued believing in himself and returned with good figures against England in the Ashes. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe return Ashes in Australia, in the same year, 2013, saw him truly emerge as a potentially good spinner for the future. He overshadowed Graeme Swann with his consistent ability and persistence to keep on flighting the ball and was rewarded with wickets at crucial junctures. The 2013 Ashes Down Under was probably won due to Mitchell Johnson but Lyon held his own.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Fast and furious, that’s the best way to describe one of the fearsome pace bowlers of the 21st century - Mitchell Aaron Starc. He burst onto the scene in the early 2009/10 season, representing New South Wales and was soon compared with Mitchell Johnson. The only similarity though was that they both were left-arm quick bowlers. Other than that they had their different style. Johnson with his slinging action relied more on pace and bounce whereas Starc with his upright action depended more on swing and deadly yorkers.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn his early days, Starc had to struggle to make to the national team as there was an army of pace bowlers waiting in the wings. The lanky left-armer often found himself in and out of the team. However, a stint with the English county side Yorkshire in 2012 did him a world of good. Post 2013, Starc’s career started to blossom and soon he became a vital part of Australia’s limited overs setup.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nA couple of fifers in back-to-back ODIs against West Indies in 2013 further sealed the deal for Mitchell Starc but his Test career still was blowing hot and cold. It was in the year 2014 when a remark made by Shane Warne in the commentary box turned things upside down. The legendary leg spinner labelled Starc’s body language ‘soft’ after his dismal performance against India in the Gabba Test in mid-December. Subsequently, Mitchell was dropped for the Boxing Day Test.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nStarc, however, didn’t lose hope. He took the criticism in his stride and to his fortune there was a Big Bash League going on at that time. He got an opportunity to prove his mettle and grabbed it with both hands. The pacer unleashed his aggressive side in a few T20 games he played for Sydney Sixers and owing to that success, the selectors reinstated him for the fourth Test against India. Mitchell Starc has not looked back since.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nFollowing years were fruitful for Mitchell Starc, who discovered a new aggressive side to his bowling. He was among the top bowlers in 2015 and finished 2016 as the most successful pace bowler in Tests after claiming 50 wickets. Not to forget his deadly bowling in the 2015 World Cup which earned him the Player of the Tournament tag and also made him the number one bowler in the ICC ODI rankings.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nBut everything comes with a price. His eagerness to bowl the extra mile put his body through a lot of strain and as a result he suffered an ankle injury and a stress fracture. The Australian team management though have managed their premium fast bowler quite well by giving him ample time to rest and recover. The quality and ability that Starc possesses, he still has not done full justice to his Test career and the Kangaroos would be hoping a lot from him in the near future.</p>",

He was the skipper of his side in 2010 but his career started going downhill from there and he was left out of the team in 2012. But as they say when one door closes the other one opens and in Alex Carey's case cricket was the other door. His start in the new sport was a dismal one but as luck would have it, Alex Carey still managed to get a rookie contract for the 2013-14 season with South Australia.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nCarey's struggle with the bat saw him try his hand at wicket-keeping. This change proved to be a life-changing one and Alex finally found his mojo. In the 2015-16 season, Carey displaced South Australia's regular keeper Tim Ludeman. His precise footwork, soft hands behind the stumps added with his promising and elegant batting saw Carey receive rave reviews. He took 57 catches in the 2016-17 Sheffield Shield and caught the eyes of the selectors.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAustralia were always looking for a wicketkeeper-batsman after the retirements of Adam Gilchrist and Brad Haddin, and the indifferent form of Matthew Wade kept that spot always open. Carey's strong Shield performance forced the selectors to discuss his name for the 2017-18 Ashes but the returning Tim Paine was preferred and Alex missed out on his Baggy Green. Carey though didn't lose hope and a strong BBL season meant that he was considered for the ODIs and T20Is as well in 2018.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAfter the infamous Cape Town Test, the Australian cricket went through some radical changes which saw Alex Carey named the deputy to Aaron Finch in white ball cricket. Looking at his good performances behind the stumps and with the bat in the middle order, Cricket Australia showed faith in him and selected him for the 2019 World Cup. Alex Carey had a great tournament scoring 375 runs in 9 innings with an average of 62.50 and a strike rate of over 100. Unfortunately, Australia couldn't beat eventual winners England in the semi-final and crashed out.</p>",

However, Cricket Australia had placed restrictions on the number of pacers allowed in a team and thus, Zampa turned to leg-spin following his idol Shane Warne. Zampa first made his way into the Australia U-19 team where he earned a spot in the 2010 squad which won the U-19 World Cup. As a result of his youth career, Zampa was given a rookie contract by New South Wales in 2010.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn the 2012-13 season, he made his first-class debut against Queensland in the Sheffield Shield. Later in 2013, he shifted to the South Australia team where he was coached by the then South African skipper Johan Botha. This was a huge turning point in his career as he was given regular opportunities and he went from strength to strength as time passed by. The 2015-16 season was his best as he became consistent with his bowling and earned a call-up to the international squad in 2016.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAdam made his ODI debut in February 2016, which was soon followed by his T20I debut against South Africa. Zampa became a regular for the Aussies in the limited-overs format. He was also included in the 2016 T20 World Cup which was to be held in India. The World Cup wasn't a success for him and neither was the ICC Champions Trophy that followed. Australia went out in the group stage as 2 of their 3 games got washed out.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAdam's promise with the ball got him selected for Rising Pune Supergiant in the Indian T20 League and the leggie went on to become the second bowler to pick a 6-wicket haul in the league history.  He also excelled while playing for the Guyana Amazon Warriors in the 2016 CPL and finished as the most successful spinner that season with 15 wickets.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nZampa's bravery to toss the ball up can be his strength but also his weakness. He has not been able to break the stronghold of other spinners in the Test squad and as a result, is yet to make his debut in the longer format. The selectors have pondered on various occasions about including him on the tours of sub-continent but so far have not zeroed on his name.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAdam was included in the 2019 World Cup squad but played only 4 matches out of a possible 10. His career so far has been a story of hits and misses and he will be looking to get a consistent run of games to prove his worth and win over the critics. </p>",

        "description": "<p>A destructive, fiery left-handed opening batsman from New South Wales, David Warner became the first Australian cricketer in 132 years to get into the national team without playing a first-class game. An outstanding fielder and a hard-hitting batter, he was the leading run-scorer in the 2005-06 season when the Australia Under-19s toured India. He then proceeded to play the Under-19 World Cup.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nWarner's domestic career took off brilliantly as he represented New South Wales and recorded the then highest one-day score of 165* for his team in the FR Cup, which immediately called for his selection in the Australian T20 side. He made his T20I debut in 2009 against South Africa, where he smashed a quick 89 off 43 balls and also played his first ODI in the same year. After some good performances with the bat in the T20 arena, Warner finally made his first-class debut for New South Wales in the Sheffield Shield season of 2008-09.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe best was yet to come for this talented and destructive southpaw. Despite making a quiet Test debut against New Zealand in 2011, Warner shone with a maiden international ton in only his fourth innings, smashing a blazing knock of 123* and nearly taking Australia to victory single-handedly. That knock was particularly special as it showed a different side to his game, where he battled it out under pressure and showed the temperament and patience for the longest format of the game. If that showed one side, then he displayed his natural destructive abilities against India in 2012 by ripping apart the Indian bowling attack, making his then career-best score of 180.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nFrom there on, Warner cemented his place in the Australian team but faced immense criticism for unnecessary off-field issues which often led to disciplinary actions. A major black mark on Warner's otherwise prolific career came when he allegedly had an altercation with Joe Root just before Australia's Ashes campaign in England, in 2013. He was then dropped for the first two Tests and asked to play for Australia A in their tour to South Africa. Warner, however, fought back hard with loads of runs in the Australian domestic season and contributed heavily in the return Ashes that followed Down Under. He scored 523 runs in the series, at an average of 58.11 which included two hundreds and as many fifties.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHis form in Test matches was extraordinary as he continued his prolific scoring. Made 543 runs in the 3-match Test series against South Africa in 2014, where he notched up twin hundreds in the Cape Town Test. He repeated this feat against India in Adelaide and what made this more special was the fact that the Aussies returned to cricket after the unfortunate death of Phillip Hughes. Warner struggled in the shorter formats though, not being able to score a century in ODIs and scoring only one half-century in T20Is in that period.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHe eventually regained his form and was back to his best again and won the Allan Border Medal in 2016 and 2017, becoming the fourth player after Ricky Ponting, Shane Watson and Michael Clarke to win it back-to-back. To add to his laurels, David became the first Australian cricketer to score seven ODI tons in a calendar year (2016), joint second with Sourav Ganguly on the all-time list and only behind Sachin Tendulkar (9).</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe left-hander was the second highest run-scorer for Australia in their 2015 World Cup winning campaign, with 345 runs in 8 games. That included a thumping of the Afghan side with a blazing 178 runs.  This was an excellent year for David to say the least. His vital presence in the team was recognized and he was made deputy to Steven Smith in the Tests and ODIs. In the Indian T20 League, he successfully represented Delhi since the opening season before going on to lead Hyderabad to the trophy in 2016. In their title-winning season, he was the second highest run-getter of the tournament with 848 runs. In 2015 and 2017, he was the highest scorer with 562 and 641 runs respectively.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nJust when it looked like things were going right for David Warner things took an unexpected turn and he had the darkest day in his cricketing life. During the third Test of Australia's tour of South Africa in 2018, Cameron Bancroft was caught tampering the ball with a foreign object (Sandpaper). David Warner was found to be the instigator of this scandal and was banned for 12 months by Cricket Australia. This also saw him being barred from the Indian T20 League in 2018.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nDavid Warner made his comeback in 2019 and showed exemplary form in the 12th edition of the Indian T20 League where he finished as the highest run-scorer. His inclusion in the 2019 World Cup squad was never in doubt once he served his punishment. David batted like a man on a missing in the mega event and finished second in the list of the top run-scorers, just one run behind Rohit Sharma.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>The southpaw from New South Wales is one of the few players in world cricket who are doing well across all formats and Australia will continue to benefit immensely from his presence.</p>",

A top-order right-handed batsman and a useful left-arm orthodox spinner, Jon-Jon Smuts was barely six when he first put on his batting pads.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nSmuts made his First-class debut for Eastern Province in 2007 and then went on to represent the South African team in the 2008 ICC U19 World Cup. He put on a gutsy 58 in the semi-final that helped his team qualify for the finals. He was also a part of the Protean team that won the 2010 Emerging Players Tournament held in Australia. Smuts represented the Warriors team in the Twenty20 arena. Later in 2015, he was named in Eastern Province Team for the African T20 Cup.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe hard-hitting all-rounder had a majestic 2016-17 season with the bat where he ended as one of the leading run-scorers of the South African T20 Cup. His all-round abilities were acknowledged by the selectors and finally, he earned an international call up in 2017. JJ made his T20I debut against Sri Lanka in January 2017 but had a mediocre start to his international career. After receiving a couple of more chances in the following series, Smuts failed to seize the opportunity and was dropped from the side. Even after failing at the international level, the all-rounder continued showcasing his brilliance at the domestic level.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn 2018, Smuts notched up 219 runs from nine matches in the Mzansi Super League and became the leading run-scorer of Nelson Mandela Bay Giants. His impressive performance at the domestic level bagged him another shot at the international level and in August 2019, he was named in South Africa's T20I squad for the series against India.</p>",

This also landed him the opportunity to captain the U-19 World Cup team which finished runners-up in 2016 in Bangladesh. His contribution with the bat wasn't much but his craving for runs never died. Ishan bounced back even harder with even better performances in the domestic circuit. He went onto score a swashbuckling 273 against Delhi, which eventually got him a call-up for the Indian T20 League. Gujarat Lions acquired the services of this talented youngster. </p>",

Mohammad was later drafted in Dhaka Dynamites team for the 2018-19 Bangladesh T20 League. The dashing opener rose to ranks during his second List A season where he amassed 807 runs in 16 matches and became the highest run-scorer of his team. Impressed with his domestic performances the selectors named him in Bangladesh's training camp in August 2019 ahead of the 2019-20 season. Eventually, Naim earned his maiden T20I call-up when Bangladesh decided to revamp their squad after disappointing results in the tri-series involving Afghanistan and Zimbabwe.  </p>",

With an impressive 65 in the first innings with the bat and figures of 4/47 with the ball, the media began dubbing him &lsquo;the next Botham&rsquo;. This however, was quickly revoked after his form with the bat took a nose-dive. With the ball though, he was very successful and prized out wicket for his team on a regular basis.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe wasn&rsquo;t blessed with a good height like some of the West Indian quicks but he was a patient customer and often watched and dissected the batsmen&rsquo;s technique in his head before bowling at them. He was England&rsquo;s first actual reverse swing bowler and changed his pace often to confuse batsmen. In combination with Andy Caddick, he found an able partner and it thus turned out to be a deadly bowling combination for England. Gough was a character who could inspire people to play according to their strengths and lift the performance of the entire team. He would often get the crowd behind the team and make things happen. The highlight of his career came in 2000-2001 when he helped England to four consecutive series wins. During this time, he also bagged the Man of the Series awards against West Indies and Sri Lanka. He succeeded in Pakistan as well but then took a hiding in the following summer against the mighty Aussies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGough announced his retirement from Test cricket in 2003 since a lingering knee injury threatened to end his career prematurely. By then he had already raked up 229 wickets at an average of 28.39. ODI cricket however, was still on his agenda and he continued playing in this form of the game. In September 2004, he became the first Englishman to take 200 wickets in ODI cricket. In 2006, he was omitted from the ODI squad which was to play India but then came back to the team to play against Pakistan. He went on to play two more ODIs and two T20I matches but then a recurrence of his knee injury forced him to withdraw from the team. That was effectively the end of his international career.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe continued playing county cricket though, and moved from Essex to Yorkshire where he formed a formidable duo with Matthew Hoggard. He was even named captain of the county side and under his captaincy, the team got off to a flier. In 2007, he suffered a broken hand but not before taking a very impressive 6/47. These were his best Yorkshire figures in about eleven years. He is now regarded as a fine professional of the game and a legend in Yorkshire colours.</p>",

An international call-up followed in the form of a Test debut against England on June 6, 1996, which was co-incidentally his birthday. It was a forgettable debut as a broken finger kept him away from bowling throughout the match. He ended up playing only 15 Tests, but was more active in the ODIs.

No other player has fused batting and bowling ability and consistently performed for a decade and a half's stretch in multiple forms of the game as Kallis has.</p>\r\n<p>Starting off as a batsman, Kallis made the first of his many tenacious hundreds by scoring 101 to save the match for South Africa against Australia in 1997 after being forced to follow on. With the cherry in hand, a 5/30 in the 1998 Knock Out trophy final helped South Africa beat West Indies and clinch glory.</p>\r\n<p>Kallis remained a permanent member of the South African team, through hard times surrounding match-fixing and poor display at home in the World Cup. More significantly, Kallis has been the backbone of sides which rebuilt under Shaun Pollock and Graeme Smith and carried their ascendency towards the top, chasing record scores and scalping series wins in previously unsettling conditions. All-rounders such as Brian McMillan and Lance Klusener remained in and out of the side but it was only Kallis whose dependability with bat and ball handed a prolonged stint in the side. His trademark cover drive over the top and the glance towards square leg would be two of the most glamorous shots in his repertoire. His batting average was among the best in the game despite a blip in 2008, while he had respectable bowling figures notching a wicket a match. </p>\r\n<p>In Tests, Kallis has recorded centuries against every side, including one each on foreign soil. As his career progressed, he tried to balance out the work load. He sat out most of the limited overs series since 2012 to keep himself fit for the longest format. But after a lean patch in the longest format of the game in 2013, he decided to retire from Test cricket. He signed off in style with a century in Durban, helping South Africa win the home Test series against India.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKallis played for the Bangalore franchise from 2008-2010 in the Indian T20 League but shifted base to Kolkata in 2011 and has been a part of the squad ever since. He played a significant role in winning Kolkata, their only league title in 2012 and was purchased for 5.5 crores as the franchise used their right to match card in the 2014 Indian T20 League auction.</p>",

        "description": "<p>One of the fastest bowlers of his time, Brett Lee once possessed the ability to bowl a delivery at 160 kph that would be a dreadful sight for most batsmen around the world.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n“Binga” as he is fondly known, made his Test debut in 1999 against India at the MCG and intimidated the Indian batters with his fiery pace, finishing with a 5-wicket haul in the first innings. His quality evident and it didn't take long for the world to see that as he went on to scalp 42 wickets in his first 7 Tests, before being sidelined for a good while due to injuries. The New South Wales seamer was capable of bowling lethal quick bouncers and had a well-disguised slower ball in his armoury, along with a destructive yorker. Lee had a knack of swinging the ball both ways - away when it’s new and reversing it when it’s old. With a charging run-up and aggressive on-field antics, it was evident that the kind of impact he made was a long-lasting one. His most successful performances came under Ricky Ponting’s captaincy, where he developed smarter and better ways of bowling at opponents and matured into an exemplary bowler, knowing when to bomb the batsmen with speed and when to contain.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe pacer went on to make his ODI debut later in 2000 against Pakistan, and was a vital figure in the Australian set up. In his illustrious ODI career, he got 380 wickets, at an average of 23.36 and an economy rate of less than 5. He was amongst the top 10 bowlers in the world since 2003, No.1 in the world in 2006. And when he took a hat-trick against Kenya in 2003, he became the first Australian to do so in a World Cup competition.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nLife for Brett Lee, however, started to become tougher after he made a comeback from ankle injuries. Unable to get into his stride and find his rhythm again, Lee was dropped from the Test following the hammering he received from India in Sydney, 2004. It took him about a year and a half to retain his place in the whites, when he made his return in Australia's 2-1 loss in the 2005 Ashes.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn a career that spanned over a decade of speedy spells, Lee was a part of the most devastating bowling attack in the Aussie camp, along with Glenn McGrath and Jason Gillespie. But when McGrath retired, Binga did an excellent job of spearheading his nation's pace attack, and his Test and ODI records justified that claim. Fast bowlers are always prone to injuries and Lee was no exception. With frequent elbow and ankle injuries, side strains and stress fractures, his career began to take a U-turn and soon, Lee gave up his Baggy Green, announcing retirement in early 2010 with a view to prolong his ODI and T20I career. With 310 wickets in 76 appearances, Lee ended his Test career on a high note but continued to build his ODI repertoire.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nBrett participated in the IPL since its inception, first under the Mohali franchise and later plying his trade for Kolkata. In 2012, he played a vital part in the Shah Rukh Khan owned franchise's title win. In the same year, a serious calf injury ruled him out in the middle of the England series, following which the veteran announced his international retirement. He, though, continued to play domestic Twenty20 competitions across the globe. In 2013, Brett returned to the Kolkata camp with an additional role of a bowling mentor, along with being his side's opening bowler.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nPost his retirement from all forms, Mr. Lee was roped in as a commentator, much like most ex-cricketers, where he now continues to share his insight about the brilliant game. His musical talent has been no secret to the world. He's been a part of a rock band called Six & Out, recorded a duet titled \"You're the one for me\" with legendary Indian singer Asha Bhosle and has gone on to make a couple of acting stints as well. Lee was a firecracker on the field, but a true gentleman off it. He was and still continues to be a shining example to young cricketers everywhere.</p>",

In 2007, he gave up his international career with South Africa and moved to Yorkshire as a Kolpak player on a three-year deal. However, consistent performances in South Africa’s domestic circuit in the 2011-12 season granted him a Test recall for the home series against Australia.

Unreal hand-eye coordination, minimal foot movement and tremendous positive instinct were the things on which this legend based his game on. It was hard to differentiate him in the middle when he was sharing the crease with the Little Master.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThere could be no Indian Test XI of all-time without Virender Sehwag featuring in it as an opener. This is the same player who was no where in contention for a place in the longest format. Sehwag could be the most important player post-2000 as he changed batting manuals completely with elan. This was on evidence specially during India’s two important Test tours against Australia and Pakistan in 2003/04 where he scored in huge number to effect a draw and a win respectively. Here was an opener who would attack bowlers from the word go. Sanath Jayasuriya had shown that in ODIs prior to him but in Tests it was Sehwag who gave the lie to all earlier conceptions of batting.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe result was six double centuries, highest by an Indian, including two triple centuries. It could safely be said that no batsman during that time won India as many Tests as Sehwag. He played several great knocks but one that comes to mind straightaway was his double century against Ajantha Mendis and Muttiah Muralitharan in Galle in 2008. While Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman had great difficulty facing them all through the series, Sehwag played them as if they were average bowlers. He played off spinners with ease and he also told his teammate Ravichandran Ashwin once that 'You know what, I don't think off-spinners are bowlers. They do not trouble me at all. I just find it easy smashing them'. That just speaks volumes of his dominating nature with the bat.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nSehwag, who had scored a ton on his Test debut in South Africa in 2001, was a part of the team that won the 2007 World T20 and 2011 World Cup and played his role to perfection. The Nawab of Najafgarh retired from international cricket in 2015 and took up cricket commentary. “Viru” is very popular with fans in his new role for his humorous observations. He was appointed as the director (Cricket Operations) for Punjab in the 2017 Indian T20 League.</p>",

Lou Vincent was one such example.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA talented and stylish right-handed batsman hailing from Auckland, Vincent had an average start to his international career at the age of 23. He was first picked for ODIs where he played a few useful knocks here and there but not something substantial to catch attention. However, Lou's agile fielding and ability to keep wickets was an added asset for him in the shorter version of game. New Zealand struggled with their opening pair on the tour of Australia in the 2001 season and then the selectors decided to hand Vincent a chance in the opening slot. The hardworking cricketer grabbed the opportunity with both hands and had a dream Test debut with an awe-inspiring century on a bouncy wicket at Perth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHis career soon ran into a bad phase, after a promising start, as he struggled to score runs consistently and was eventually dropped from the Test team. Though, he continued to be in the scheme of things for the ODIs. His poor form sustained and then he had to pay a hefty price by losing his place in the one day side as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter spending a year out of international cricket, the Aucklander made a comeback in 2005 to Test cricket with a sedate show against Australia in the home series. A month after his return he managed to score an enthralling double century against Sri Lanka and to an extent proved his worth in the side. A good show in the longer format also earned him a recall in the ODIs and he responded with a massive 172 runs in his comeback match.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the retirement of Nathan Astle and Chris Cairns, Vincent became a regular member of the ODI team. Due to the implementation of a rotation policy by New Zealand board, Vincent lost his place in the team and later also suffered from major depressive disorders. His decision to join the rebel league in India resulted in the termination of his contract. However, Vincent continued to give services to his home club, Auckland and was a vital cog in their strategies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2013, Vincent announced his retirement from all forms of the game on a microblogging site, thereby drawing curtains on a decent 16-year first-class career.</p>",

While never struggling initially, during the tour of South Africa, his medium-pace bowling looked toothless on bouncy continental surfaces, often being severely punished for runs. His bowling grew in stature as months passed, and he additionally honed his batting skills, improving as a pinch-hitter. By the 1999 World Cup, he replaced Rameez Raja at the number three slot. His ability to rotate strike and be a handy pinch-hitter adapted Razzaq to either come in at the loss of an early wicket or consolidate a good start. During the 1999 World Cup in England, he was a key member in Pakistan’s final-place finish. Progress in ODIs over his first three years was deemed well enough for a Test debut, earning his maiden green cap in a one-off appearance on tour to Australia in 1999. It took him seven innings to register his first Test fifty, scored during Pakistan’s travel to the West Indies. A maiden Test century came in 2000 at Faisalabad in England’s sub continental visit.

While injuries have taken its toll on the multifaceted Razzaq, he still remains one of Pakistan cricket’s enduring faces during his current era that peaked and toughened in symmetry.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Notoriously remembered as 'Padams' for his defensive style of cricket, Jimmy Adams is one of the most versatile cricketers to have ever played for the West Indies. He batted left-handed, bowled slow left-arm orthodox and also kept wickets occasionally. A veteran of 54 Test matches for the Windies was a potent middle order batsman.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdams burst on to the international cricket scene as he scored 1132 runs in only 12 Test matches at an average of 87, which included two massive hundreds. Only Sir Donald Bradman bettered this record in the history of cricket. He scored big hundreds easily because of his painstaking and slow style of accumulating runs. Adams' cautious approach to batting provided a foil to Brian Lara's fluid style. In 1995 on a tour to England Jimmy's got hit on the face by Somerset bowler Andre Van Troost, which shattered his cheekbone. After that hit he could not recapture his run-scoring prowess. Later, Jimmy took over captaincy from Brian Lara. He got off to a flying start by winning four and drawing two of the first six games as skipper, but thereafter the Windies lost seven of their eight matches including a 5-0 whitewash at the hands of Australia. Subsequently he was replaced by Carl Hooper. Adams was a spectacular gully fielder. He mustered 2204 runs in 127 ODIs, at an average of 28.62. His strike rate in ODIs was a rather pedestrian 60.98. His slow left arm bowling reaped 43 ODI wickets and 27 Test wickets as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdams hung his boots in 2001, his career may have ended in failure as captain and batsman but his contribution to West Indies cricket cannot be quantified. In 2006, he took up the role of manager of the U-19 West Indies cricket team. He works as a cricket commentator and assists in the development of cricket in the Caribbean though his native Jamaica.</p>",

The right-arm fast bowler is not just one of the greatest from the land of the Caribbean but also a celebrated icon on the world stage. Christened, ‘Little Bird’, he soared to dizzying heights, breaking numerous records to become one of the leading wicket-takers of all time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAmbrose’s contribution to West Indies cricket in an era that followed a legion of fast bowling greats was remarkable to say the least. He made his Test debut in 1988, joining a team which had a number of stalwarts like Viv Richards, Desmond Haynes, Gordon Greenidge Malcolm Marshall and Courtney Walsh. This simply meant that he had to learn quickly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe “Little Bird” wasn’t the greatest swinger of the cricket ball but more than made up with unswerving accuracy. His height gave him the ability to get the ball to rise steeply off a good length, besides bowling bouncers at will. His brisk run-up & fast action added to his sting. His best performance in terms of most wickets in an innings was an 8 for 45 against England in 1990 but there were other unforgettable outings too. Ambrose seemed to be on top of his game whenever he played England and in 34 Tests against them, he picked 164 wickets. His appetite for wickets was a big strength and an overall tally of over 400 scalps speaks for itself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBarring a one-off Test 50 to his name, the Antiguan was a disaster with a bat in his hand! At the fag-end of his career, his bowling too lacked pace, but he retained the ability to consistently hit the right areas which was the secret behind his efficiency and the low economy rates that he managed to maintain. His formidable partnership with Courtney Walsh – another noteworthy highlight of his career- was one that any bowling pair would envy. The two pacers prowled through the cricket world in-tandem, terrorizing batsmen across the globe during the nineties.</p>",

His agility in the field and useful off-breaks provided Sri Lanka with a multi-utility player.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe gangly left-hander may not have been easy on the eye with his stroke play but he was pretty effective. He started out his career mainly as a top order batsman. Arnold made his debut for Sri Lanka, opening the innings in a Test match against Pakistan in 1997. It took him two years to cement a place in both the formats, and in 1999 scored his highest of 123 against Pakistan in the Lahore Test. Owing to inconsistent displays and rise of Marvan Atapattu, Russel was demoted down the order. In 2002, the southpaw got his second chance to come and play from his usual position due to Jayasuriya’s lack of form. He replied with the scores of 62 and 109, but, they were in vain as England still managed to win the match. After that, Arnold managed to play a handful of Tests before being dropped from the squad.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the ODIs, ‘Rusty’ managed a better career, his gritty attitude saw him take the Lankans to victory from many tight situations. His solitary ODI century (103) doesn’t even begin to define his importance in the team in the shorter version. He still suffered the drop from the national side in 2004 as the selectors wanted to blood fresh talent. On the basis of strong performances in the domestic circuit, Arnold broke back into the squad in 2005 against India. His position was seriously under threat from the likes of Tillakaratne Dishan and the pressure spoke as he lost his place in the side again, following a disastrous tour of England in 2006. Arnold made his return to the ODI team on the basis of experience for the 2007 World Cup after which he retired from international cricket. He then joined the rebel league and was banned by the SLC for the same. Once his ban was lifted, Arnold resumed domestic cricket and took up audio commentary.</p>",

He has also represented Yorkshire, Kent, Leicestershire and Sussex in England.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe “Pyjama Picasso” made his ODI debut for Australia in 1994. Known as “The Finisher”, he would often come to the team’s rescue after a top-order collapse. Batting at number four, he played 232 matches for his team, with a classic average of 53.58. Bevan’s Test career was relatively short-lived and less successful than his ODI career. He was highly susceptible to short-pitched deliveries and hence, could not succeed in the longer version of the game. However, his left-arm chinaman spin helped him as an all-rounder in the team.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2007, Bevan retired from all forms of international cricket following a series of injuries. Later in 2011, he was appointed as the coach of the Kings XI Punjab, a franchise of the IPL.</p>",

Had it not been for the mesmerizing Gilchrist, the workman like Boucher wouldn’t be overshadowed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a lower middle-order batsman, Boucher was symbolic of how traditionally deep South Africa have always batted. While not a holder of startling averages, he’s a product of well played cameos. His career highlight came in 2006 when playing Australia; Boucher scored the winning runs in what is regarded as the greatest ODI ever played, when his team successfully chased the then-record ODI score of 434, quickly refreshing record-books. However, it was disappointing to see a cricketer of his calibre being dropped, when in 2010, Boucher played his last ODI and was not included thereafter, even in the World Cup that followed. But in 2011, a freak injury to their regular wicket-keeper AB de Villiers announced his comeback to the one-day side for South Africa's series against Australia. In the Indian T20 league, Boucher started off in 2009 by playing for Bengaluru before Kolkata bagged him in the next season.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThrough it all, his performance behind the wicket became unbeatable after initially struggling with the role. With the help of the then coach Bob Woolmer, he put in extra shifts to hone the skill. It’s part of the reason why Boucher plays second fiddle to gifted talents such as Adam Gilchrist, Andy Flower, and later MS Dhoni. Never a natural, he’s a product of hard-work and dedication, two qualities that have epitomized South Africa through trying times. In 2012, Boucher injured his left eye in a freak accident on a tour match before the England series, and hence announced his retirement from all forms of the game.</p>",

He was a hard-hitting middle order batsman who was able to hit monstrous sixes straight down the ground and was a clever fast-medium pace bowler too.

Cairns ended as New Zeland’s third highest wicket-taker, behind only Hadlee and Vettori. His best performance with the ball came in 1998 during a Test match between New Zealand and West Indies where he took 7 West Indian batsmen and gave away just 27 runs. With the bat, Cairns was as destructive as many modern day batsmen. He helped his team in the final of the ICC Knockout Trophy in Kenya in 2000 where he scored an unbeaten century against India to guide his team all the way. He hit a formidable 14 sixes in this innings and sent the Indians packing. He also achieved the rare feat of hitting Shane Warne out of the attack during a Test match in 2000 in Wellington. He formerly held the world record for most sixes in Test match cricket.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs mentioned earlier, Cairns possessed immense cricketing talent but was unable to harness it with the plethora of injuries he suffered throughout his career.

In 2006, he called it quits from the ODI format as well and he played his last match for New Zealand in a T20I encounter against West Indies.

By the end of the Asia Cup in 2004, he was became an important wicket-taker for Sri Lanka. Unfortunately, his form began to fall over and he was dropped as a result of this in 2005. He made another appearance in the team in 2007 and then announced his retirement. Following this, Chandana decided to join the rebel league in India and played for Kolkata. This got him a ban from the Sri Lankan board and he was not allowed to play domestic cricket. The ban was lifted in 2008 which meant that Chandana was free to play in the domestic circuit again.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Shivnarine Chanderpaul has been the backbone of the West Indies batting line-up for more than a decade now. The first Indo-Caribbean to play 100 Tests for the West Indies, Chanderpaul made his debut way back in 1994. Since then, he has only grown from strength to strength.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEarlier, a victim of a floating bone in his feet, Chanderpaul found it difficult to convert his starts into big scores, which eventually showed a poor conversion-rate. But in late 2000, he got rid of this defect as the bone was removed and Chanderpaul set about writing a new chapter in his cricketing life. He scored centuries against India in 2001-02, followed by a successful home series against Australia. His form continued for the next couple of years, until he got into a lean patch on the England tour. But then there was the Champions Trophy, where his consistency helped a great deal for the team's title-win. Captaincy soon arrived and he welcomed it with open arms, but later resigned in 2006 to concentrate on his batting. His prolific scoring, though, continued to be his strength in the years that followed. In 2012, he opted to play for the shortest format of the game, representing Uva Next in the inaugural Sri Lanka Premier League. Shivnarine Chanderpaul played a match along with his son, Tagenarine Chanderpaul, a promising young talent from Guyana for a local team, Gandhi Youth Organisation in 2012.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe southpaw is a gritty customer at the crease and has a knack of preserving his wicket like it were his own baby. With an unorthodox batting stance, Chanderpaul also has the ability to marshal the tail-enders at will. His off-the-wall stance and technique makes it clear that self-coaching is also a great asset. He has no signs of backing down in spite of age not being on his side and after his 150th Test in 2013 which coincided with Sachin Tendullkar's 200th and last Test, Chanderpaul is that unfazed, untouched and yet strong rock by an ocean which remains strong as ever.<br />\r\n </p>",

Following his ODI debut against Pakistan in 2001, Collingwood’s first five outings averaged a mere 11.2. Selector- persistence eventually paid off when he notched 3 half-centuries in his next five innings. Combination of selective stroke-play and an ability to rotate strike to keep the scoreboard ticking often saw him play the sheet anchor role. His elusive Test debut came during the end of 2003 - after extended stints as England’s 12th man owing to his fielding ability - replacing flu-afflicted skipper Nasser Hussain in Galle during England’s trip to Sri Lanka. Although he scored a mere 37 in two innings with the bat, his fielding caught the eye once again when he held a total of 5 catches and caused a run-out. By 2005, Collingwood was an ODI regular and went on to become England’s most successful batsman by becoming the first-ever Englishman to cross the 5000-run mark; also their highest run-getter for a long, long time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the Ashes later that year, he replaced the injured Simon Jones in the final Test. He bowled some vital overs for a draw, resulting in a historic triumph for England against their old foes. More opportunities came, that Collingwood grabbed, the highlight being a 206 against Australia in Adelaide. His performances aided sub-continent success and in 2007 the same year, he became Michael Vaughan’s ODI successor. Despite mixed results, in 2008, he relinquished captaincy citing inability to enjoy the game as the reason. Still, his Test form kept improving, reflecting in England’s 2009 Ashes retention. That year, Collingwood replaced Alec Stewart as England’s most-capped ODI player.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2010, skipper “Colly” led the England side to their first-ever global success in the ICC World Twenty20, hitting the winning boundary against Australia. The Test retirement came on a high note, as England regained the 2010-11 Ashes and Collingwood bid adieu with pride. Eventually, the T20I captaincy was taken over by team-mate Stuart Broad.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite his sudden exit from the international arena, especially ODIs and T20Is, Collingwood continued to ply his trade for his domestic county, Durham. In 2011, the veteran was signed up by the Perth Scorchers for the inaugural Big Bash League.</p>",

However only 20, he failed to adjust to the tempo of the big stage and just two games later lost his place in the side. However Pakistan gave him another chance against a nascent Bangladesh side in 2001 and he couldn&rsquo;t have scripted a better comeback scalping 25 wickets in just 3 tests against its neighbours. After a brief dip in form in 2002, Kaneria started showing steady improvement and with Saqlain Mushtaq fading into oblivion slowly started cementing his place in the side. He came of age in the 2005 away series against India prizing 19 wickets, an unexpected feat against a country reputed to treat spinners with disdain. A fine run against the West Indies, Kaneria&rsquo;s stock was growing and in 2007 ended up with 37 wickets in just 8 tests. A rare test win against New Zealand away from home in 2009 was also in large part due to the leg spinner&rsquo;s efforts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnusually tall for a spinner, Kaneria can turn the ball significantly with his well disguised googly along with his ability to generate disconcerting bounce making him a potent wicket taking machine. However despite his variety and fine control, his tactical naiveness has cost him on occasions with his inability to replicate the success in ODIs challenging the notion of him of being Pakistan&rsquo;s premier spinner. Till now, Kaneria hasn&rsquo;t been pushed for places in the Test arena but now with the emergence of a world class spinner in Ajmal, he will know that he may well be pushed for places even in the longer format of the game.</p>",

In only his 2nd Test, he scored a composed 163 against Zimbabwe. He made his ODI debut in the same year against the same opposition. However, after being granted numerous chances, he failed to impress and endured a miserable period between 2001 and 2003 when he was dropped on several occasions. Even after his comeback, Dilshan did little to inspire his confidence. In 2007-08, he was relegated to captain the Sri Lanka 'A' side after he was dropped for Sri Lanka's Test series in Australia. To prove his detractors wrong, Dilshan slammed 111 and 78 in two of the three innings thus guiding his team to a 3-0 clean sweep over Zimbabwe. He was then recalled for the ODI series in Australia and scored 62 runs of just 59 balls, opening the innings against India. But after failing in the next two games, he was demoted to the middle order where he was wasted for the next 11 months.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKumar Sangakkara, Michael Vandort and Sanath Jayasuriya were tried during this period but they all failed, giving Dilshan a second chance to open the innings in a match against Pakistan in 2009. Dilshan grabbed the bull by its horns and since then has become the first choice opener for Sri Lanka in all three formats. He now exhibits a self belief and confidence which was previously lacking in his game. He is ruthless in the Powerplays, constantly attempting to clear the infield but has become much more sensible interspersing it with singles and twos. He is the pioneer of the 'Dilscoop' - a shot where he paddles the ball over his own head and the wicket-keeper's in a typically unique style.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA brilliant fielder, Dilshan is also a useful off-spinner. His transition had been such that he was made Sri Lanka's captain in ODIs and T20Is on more occasions than one. Following Sangakkara's resignation as the Sri Lankan skipper post the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup, Dilshan was eventually handed over the captaincy in all three formats, before being replaced by team-mate Mahela Jayawardene post their disastrous South African tour. To give away his spot to groom a youngster, Dilshan took retirement from the Test format in October, 2013 but continues to be an important part of the limited overs team.</p>",

He was, arguably, a world-class performer in the South African ranks, and commanded huge respect from teammates and fans alike. However, over bowling in the peak of his career opened the door to injuries, which ultimately resulted in his exit from the game.

        "description": "<p>It’s hard to plot Rahul Dravid on the graph of cricketing greats. There has rarely been a historic Indian win without a vital contribution from ‘The Wall’, yet, playing in the Tendulkar era, his achievements have been eclipsed by the blinding presence of the great ‘Little Master’.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the three prominent Karnataka cricketers to make their mark in the 90s, along with Anil Kumble and Javagal Srinath, Dravid seemed like he was born out of a batting manual with a strikingly “textbook” technique. In an age where batsmen were innovating and tweaking the norm as the game evolved, Dravid stuck by the methods that he was blooded with. His earliest Test impact of note following a 95 on debut was against South Africa in 1997, when he backed his maiden century (148) with a half-century to lead India to a rare away draw. A series of impressive knocks strengthened Dravid's foundation in the team. Lack of flamboyance was his lone limitation during his formative years. Whilst effective in Tests, it often frustrated fans in limited overs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA metamorphosis took place during the 1999 World Cup, beyond which Dravid’s batting became a marvellous sight to behold in all forms of the game. By 2002, he successfully shed his defensive style and no longer seemed shadowed by the famed Tendulkar-Ganguly opening duo. Since then, the Number 3 batsman carved his own niche as India’s batting anchor. A decade and a half later, he became the only Indian batsman barring Tendulkar never to have been dropped from the Test side since debut.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollowing the match-fixing controversy, he was appointed deputy to captain Ganguly and the added responsibility egged Dravid to greater consistency. He notably played a vital supporting role to VVS Laxman in India’s historic defeat of an all-conquering Australia in 2001. By 2004, he had scored centuries against every Test-playing nation. Captaincy duty soon arrived but the spotlight repulsed him. It also affected his ODI form and after a poor 2007 World Cup he relinquished the armband to focus on his batting and was consequently dropped from ODIs and left out in the cold for 2 years. Still, his position in the classic format remained untouched, unquestioned. Few could match his Test achievements, which remained consistent as ever, vindicating him even when people around were losing faith. He carried his huge experience in the IPL, where he represented the Royal Challengers Bangalore as captain in the first edition, before being bought by the Rajasthan Royals in 2011. He was then named captain-cum-coach-cum mentor of the Royals ahead of the fifth IPL edition in 2012.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite being a batsman of high calibre, Dravid was not a part of the 2011 World Cup winning squad, but remained an integral cog in the Test set-up. He had a fabulous summer in England that year, notching 3 centuries in 4 Tests. In what was his final visit to the Mecca of Cricket - “Lord's”, Dravid registered his name on the Honours board with a memorable ton. His performances in the Test series prompted the selectors to hand him an ODI recall and surprisingly, he received his maiden T20I call-up as well. It was his only T20 International, and even before making his debut, Dravid had already announced his retirement from the format.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLater that year, a dismal tour of Australia was followed by one of the most heartbreaking news for his fans and followers, as the strongest pillar of Indian cricket finally hung his boots from all forms of international and domestic first-class cricket. Dravid announced his retirement on 9th March, 2012, bringing down the curtains on one of the most legendary cricketing careers of all time.</p>",

The southpaw was an integral member of Zimbabwe’s World Cup squad in 2003 and matured into a fine batsman with decent outings in the Test arena as well. His last three Test innings were particularly half centuries. One of his most memorable innings was a gritty hundred against India in 2003-04 in the VB Series, when Ervine had almost pulled off a wonderfully scripted run-chase. However, further problems with Zimbabwe’s Cricket Board compelled him to bow out of the fold and he thus moved to Australia. Two seasons on the sidelines with Western Australia and he was called up to play in the Pura Cup.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nErvine made another move, this time towards England as he signed to play for Hampshire in 2009. Despite a successful season with the county, he moved back to his original country and announced his domestic comeback with a maiden first-class double hundred. He was then named in Zimbabwe’s ODI squad for the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup. However, Ervine rethought his decision and pulled out at the last minute, opting to return to county cricket. In 2012, he was part of Hampshire’s T20 side that won their domestic T20 competition, beating Yorkshire in the finals. Later that year, he was included in the Champions League T20 squad.<br />\r\n </p>",

After completing only two years into domestic cricket, he earned a national call-up and made his Test debut against Pakistan in 2000, picking up two wickets in the 1st innings. In only his 2nd Test, he rattled the South Africans with his pace and bounce, bagging six wickets and thereafter made his ODI debut against them in 2001. Later, niggling injuries compounded with inconsistent line and length cost him a place in the side.

He has, though, struggled with no balls and is someone who can either win or lose you a match on his day.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2008, Fernando was signed by the IPL franchise Mumbai Indians ahead of the inaugural edition of the Twenty20 competition.

Tagged as the next Ian Botham of England, Flintoff is an explosive right-handed batsman and a lethal fast bowler. He is the most intimidating cricketer in world cricket with his hard-hitting batting and intimidating bowling. The initial days in his international career were jolted by inconsistency and injuries. However, he established himself as a cricketer during the 2005 Ashes series where he was named Man of the Series for his all-round skills as England won back the coveted urn. The big Englishman is one of the fiercest strikers of the cricket ball and has the potential to turn the game on its head with his dominating style of batting. The well-built Lancashire all-rounder bowls at a lively pace and frustrates the opponent batsmen with his sharp bouncers and swinging yorkers. With his huge hands, Flintoff is also an excellent slip fielder. 'Freddie' was the skipper of the English side when they were whitewashed in the 2006-07 Ashes. However injuries soon got the better of the big man as he was forced to sit on the sidelines and enjoy the view rather than intimidate the opposition on the field. Since the 2005 Ashes, Flintoff has averaged 28.25 with the bat and 34.68 with the ball in 23 Tests out of the 48 games England played during this period. Both figures signify a dipping ebb when compared to his overall Test record of 31.69 and 32.51. To add insult to injury, he has not managed a century or five wickets in an innings in any series since then. He was purchased for a record sum of 1.5 million dollars at the auction of the second season of the Indian Premier League by the Chennai franchise. Injury again reared its ugly head and he was ruled out after only a handful of matches and less-than-par performances. He was subsequently ruled out of the World Twenty20 2009. Struggling to regain fitness for the Ashes, Flintoff then took a drastic step and announced that he would retire from Test cricket at the end of the 2009 Ashes. He did, however, mention that this move should make him more available for ODIs and Twenty20s, considering his vulnerability to injury. He emphasized his importance in the side by picking up 5 wickets in the second Ashes Test as England took a 1-0 series lead over Australia.</p>",

Despite possessing the temperament to play long innings, he slipped to the No. 6 position in ODIs, after realizing that much of his success came in that place. He was a powerful striker of the ball and a brilliant, athletic fieldsman. Grant made his ODI and Test debut against India in 1992, and immediately impressed with a fine knock of 82 in the first one-day international. He contributed significantly to Zimbabwe's first-ever Test victory with a unbeaten double ton, but soon lost the form and his batting averages were enough proof. With Andy's retirement soon after, Grant was expected to carry the team's responsibility on his shoulders, but an unsuccessful tour to England in 2003 exposed his weaknesses. Add to it, a broken thumb and he was ruled of the Australia tour that followed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInjury woes coupled with the dispute between Zimbabwe's rebel players and the board compelled Grant to call it quits and in 2004, he played his last Test match against Bangladesh, before hanging his boots. However, he quickly signed up with Essex and spent six successful county seasons there; as brother Andy was already established with the county. Following the final season in 2010, Grant returned to Zimbabwean Cricket and took up the position of their batting coach. To everyone's surprise, he also made a shocking comeback to the field when he played two ODIs against South Africa later that year. With limited success there, he turned to domestic cricket in Zimbabwe and captained Mashonaland to an inspiring Twenty20 title win in 2010-11. Finally, with a fruitful career behind him, Grant decided to dedicate himself towards full-time coaching.</p>",

He continued to put up impressive scores in the series that followed, first against India and then Pakistan. But eventually, his form kept dripping and he was soon neglected by the selectors, hinting towards a drop from the squad. Following Ramnaresh Sarwan's injury that ruled him out during the England tour, Ganga was handed over the team's captaincy, but did no good as he could not strike with the bat. He made a comeback for a series against the Proteas in 2008, but failed miserably in his six innings. Ganga spent majority of 2009 outside the national team, but did not stop playing cricket.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLess success on the big stage did not deter this Trinidad-born player from making waves on the domestic front. Ganga led his side, Trinidad & Tobago to the finals of the Stanford 20/20, winning the tournament and furthermore, earning the team a place in the Champions League T20 held in India that year.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Regarded as one of India’s most successful captains in modern times, Sourav Ganguly will be best remembered for his elegant cricketing style and vast contribution to cricket in India in a career spanning around 15 long years. He was not only India's most successful overseas Test captain, but also ensured he infuse an unknown term in Indian cricket - aggression. The 2003 World Cup final would always be his biggest achievement where most of the critics did not give India much chance.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe “Prince of Kolkata” went on to become one of the greatest ODI batsmen of all time, although his career halted at intervals. He became an effective Test captain, carving a bunch of young and talented players into a winning unit. His stroke play was a combination of grace and precision, and his domination on the off-side masked him as the “God of off side”. While his critics opined that he was unable to face bouncers, others were amazed by his marvelous ability to galvanize the field on the off side with crystal clear precision. Together with Sachin Tendulkar, he formed one of the most damaging opening pairs in ODI cricket history. However, he was always under the hammer for his lack of fitness and athleticism.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n“Dada” as he is fondly known, took over as the captain of the Indian team at a time when the game of cricket was disrupted with match-fixing allegations in 2000. Ganguly emerged as a tough, able and an adamant leader, who took his team to miraculous heights, winning Test matches away from home. India continued to be on the winning streak right till the 2003 ICC Cricket World Cup finals. Soon after, his career saw a downfall as the loss of his personal form coincided with India’s bland ODI performances and a new leader arrived in the form of Rahul Dravid. A fallout with Greg Chappell, the coach he himself suggested to the BCCI resulted and it looked like that was it. Surprisingly, he made a splendid comeback after being axed from captaincy and continued his prolific scoring in Test cricket. The “Maharaja” finally retired from international cricket in 2008 after playing his last Test against Australia at home.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nPost retirement, Ganguly continued to play cricket for his state team, Bengal and also signed up with Kolkata in 2008 for the Indian T20 League. He represented the franchise till 2010, but was, shockingly left out of the 2011 auctions as none of the franchises bid for him; until Pune signed him in place of an injured Ashish Nehra. The following year, he led his franchise in absence of regular skipper Yuvraj Singh, and also became the mentor of his team. Dada soon took to commentary as well. He still remains an integral part of Indian cricket, serving as a member of the Cricket Advisory Committee.</p>",

Underneath his will to capture imaginations, is a cricketer whose adaptability has convincingly seen him through the game’s changing phases.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs soon as he found his international footing, Gibbs replaced Andrew Hudson as Gary Kirsten’s opening partner. Along with teammate Jonty Rhodes at point, he at cover developed a reputation for spectacular out fielding, fascinating viewers with diving stops. It increased emphasis on a part of cricket often overlooked as menial. With the willow, a maiden Test century came in an unbeaten 211 against New Zealand at Christchurch in 1999. Earlier in the year, Gibbs also notched his first ODI ton against West Indies at home. Around the time, his batting was well balanced, mixing defensive caution with aggressive force in equal measure. A strong 1999 also booked him a spot in South Africa’s World Cup squad for that year. A largely disappointing showing for Gibbs on a personal front was capped with a dropped catch of Steve Waugh, one of the reasons that caused South Africa’s ouster.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe pinnacle of his ability to single-handedly turn games was chiefly witnessed in his 175-run knock against Australia in 2006, a match that saw the highest runs scored in ODI history set by the Aussies and in the same innings, successfully chased by South Africa. That match-winning knock was memorable atonement for his error in the 1999 World Cup. It showcased Gibbs’ unfathomable ability to turn thing his team’s favour when called upon. It also reflected his transition from run-a-ball innings to explosive ones, in line with the changing nature of cricket. After Jonty Rhodes retired, Gibbs was heir apparent in his team's point position. It told a lot about Gibbs, the man who was South Africa’s replacement for two seemingly irreplaceable heroes – Hudson and Rhodes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnfortunately, Cricket South Africa did not offer him another contract after their series against the West Indies in 2008, thereby putting a halt to his Test career. Gibbs was then signed up by the Deccan Chargers to play in the inaugural season of the IPL in 2008. He was a consistent performer and along with Adam Gilchrist, was instrumental in the Chargers' victory in the second edition. In 2012, he was picked by the Mumbai Indians for the fifth season. The same year, he was grabbed by the Perth Scorchers for the Champions League T20.</p>",

A quintessential batsman to have at the top of the order in ODIs and someone who brought glamour to the wicket-keeper batsman role, Gilly changed the complexion of Tests at number seven.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>Gilchrist made his international debut in ODIs as a wicket-keeper against South Africa in 1996. He started his career in a similar manner to Tendulkar, coming lower down the order. He made some useful contributions there, however in the day and age of pinch-hitters – or batsmen who could take advantage of the fielding restrictions – he was sent to open the innings. It all changed for him since then as he went on to score his maiden century in his very second such match against South Africa in Sydney.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>His aggressive batting and consistency benefited his team a lot which paved the way for his Test debut. His Test career was off in a great fashion, scoring 81 on debut and his first ton - an unbeaten 149 in his second Test. It was an innings of substance as it came in the fourth innings of a Test against Pakistan, chasing down a stiff target of 369 and that too after being 126/5 at one stage. Over the next few years, Gilchrist maintained this style of play, i.e. attacking from the hilt, and walking when he knew he was out irrespective of the umpire’s decision.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>His first and only double century came against South Africa in Johannesburg in 2002. It proved to be the Man of the Match performance as Australia handed an innings defeat to the Proteas. Two years later, while touring India, he replaced injured Ricky Ponting as the skipper for the first three games and won 2 of them, leading his side for the first Test series victory in India since 1969/70.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>His strike rate of 82 in Tests and 97 in ODIs combined with the averages of 47 and 36 respectively, coupled with the fact that he was the frontline wicket-keeper of the team, keeping dexterously to Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath alike, made him one of the greats of the game. This was a major reason for Australia's dominance at that time. He also played a huge role in their three successive World Cup campaigns. In the 1999 World Cup, though he wasn't in great touch, his 54 in the finals proved to be a tournament winning one. In contrary, he had much better performances in the 2003 and 2007 World Cups. In the former, he piled up 408 runs, including a 48-ball 57 against India in the finals. And in 2007, he scored a magnificent 149 against Sri Lanka in the finals to secure hat-trick of World Cups for Australia.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>During the 2007-08 Test series against India, Gilchrist dropped a few sitters behind the wickets and realized that he had lost the competitive edge. He didn't take long to announce his retirement after that. However, he was active in the domestic scene and participated in the Indian T20 League, becoming a part of the Hyderabad squad in the inaugural edition in 2008. In fact, it was under his wise captaincy that they won their first-ever trophy in 2009. Later, Gilchrist was signed by the Punjab franchisee and named the captain as well. In 2012, he was given the added responsibility of coaching them as well.</p>",

He had a rather quick arm action for a spinner but generated a lot of bounce due to his height. 'Gilo' made his debut for Warwickshire in 1993 but couldn’t manage to break into the ODI side until May 1997, following some good performances in the domestic circuit in 1996. Once he made it to the English national side, Giles had a start-stop ODI career as he played only a handful of matches until 2002. He was although, a regular in the Test side and had a memorable tour of the sub-continent in 2000-2001 season bagging 25 wickets in 6 matches. He tormented the likes of Inzamam-ul-Haq with his sharp spinning deliveries. But, a niggling Achilles injury forced him to stay out of the Ashes. He came back strongly against India to bag 5 wickets in the Ahmedabad Test.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGiles endured a lean spell with the ball for two years, reason being he changed his action. He managed to come back strongly against Sri Lanka taking 18 wickets on that tour and played a match-saving knock along with Mark Butcher in the first Test at Galle. He also had a 70-run unbeaten stand with G Thorpe in the fourth innings that saved England the blushes. He continued to provide runs for the team lower down the order.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA decent fielder with a strong arm, Giles was forced out of the side due to a recurrent hip injury and was very soon replaced by Monty Panesar. His 2006-2007 Ashes tour came to an early end as Panesar was knocking on the door with a five-wicket haul at Perth. Also, Giles had to fly back home to be with his ailing wife that compelled him to call it quits. The constant hip injury concerns extinguished any chances of a comeback and in August 2007, Giles officially announced his retirement from all forms of cricket. Following his retirement, Giles became Warwickshire's director of cricket. In 2008, he was elected in the national selection panel. Four years later, he was named England’s head coach in limited-overs cricket, sharing the role with their Test coach and director, Andy Flower.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Australia’s first Test cricketer of Aboriginal descent, Jason Gillespie was a successful bowler for the national side between 1996 and 2006. Gillespie was the perfect partner to bowl in tandem with for the likes of Aussie greats like McGrath, Warne and Fleming and constituted a deadly partnership with them to terrorize batting line ups around the world. However, he was injury prone throughout his career and this caused disparities in his performances in series.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGillespie bowled with good pace initially and was clocked at speeds between 140-150 kph until 2001. Due to a string of injuries, he was forced to bowl from a shorter run up and this inadvertently affected his pace which slipped down to the mid 130s and early 140’s. On his day though, he was still a handful. His main strength was his ability to make the ball move either way and operated with an upright seam. More often than not, he would bowl in the toughest of conditions, without complaint. He was not one who would dominate batting attacks like his decorated opening partner, McGrath and the highest number of wickets he has taken in a series is 20. Apart from just his bowling ability, this long haired warrior was also a very handy lower order batsman and night watchman. The highlight of his career came in 2006 in a match against Bangladesh at Chittagong. He stuck to the crease for 425 balls and 574 minutes and top scored with 201 and in the process helped his side to an innings and 80-run victory. His 201 is the highest ever score for a night watchman in Test cricket.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGillespie played for South Australia in the Australian domestic circuit and for Yorkshire in the English domestic circuit. For Yorkshire, he scored an impressive 123 in a 246 run partnership with Tim Bresnan on his 32nd birthday. Injuries however, were never too kind on Gillespie. He regularly suffered from various ailments like stress fractures in the back, hips, side-strains, shoulders, hamstrings and finally a broken leg. He played only 52 of the 92 possible Tests between his debut and his axing from the team but in spite of all these ailments, his accuracy and economy was impeccable.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollowing his retirement from cricket, Gillespie began coaching in Zimbabwe and worked primarily with the Midwest Rhinos but also works towards the improvement of performance of younger players in the country. In 2011, he was drafted in as the bowling coach of IPL side Kings XI Punjab. A year later, he was appointed coach of the Yorkshire County Cricket Club.</p>",

But with the legend's retirement, Haddin emerged from his shadows and carved a niche for himself in Australia's young side. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHaddin, who began his domestic career with New South Wales, was rewarded for his consistent performances when he earned his ODI call-up in 2001 and debuted against Zimbabwe. But in the following years, he would be called upon only when Gilchrist required rest or be injured, fully aware of the fact he would have to make way on the left hander's return. But with his adept wicket-keeping and batting, Haddin continued to remain in the selectors' fray who at times were forced to play him as a specialist batsman. With consistent knocks, he was continually staking his claim and when Gilchrist finally bowed out in 2008, Haddin was named his successor. Seven long years after his ODI debut, the glove man made his Test debut against West Indies and earned a piece of history as Australia's 400th debutant, who continued to play throughout the series despite a broken finger. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n\"BJ\" as he is nicknamed, soon became integral to the Australian team for his ability to float across the batting order with his constant chatter behind the stumps also acting as a source of inspiration. His maiden Test century of 169 against New Zealand was one which even Gilchrist would have been proud of and in early 2010, he also scored his maiden ODI century against the same opposition. An elbow injury ruled him out of the 2010 Test series against India and despite Paine's exemplary performances, Haddin was retained for the Ashes. In 2011, however, he announced his retirement from Twenty20 internationals, in order to prolong his Test and ODI career. Domestic cricket also progressed side by side, when he was signed up by the Sydney Sixers to play in the inaugural Big Bash League in 2011. He was made captain and tasted success when Sydney Sixers won the CLT20, 2012 edition.  After a rather poor 2011 season, Haddin was eventually dropped in the 2012 season in favour of Tasmanian, Matthew Wade. But Wade didn't have anything to boast about when was selected for the South Africa series in 2012 and eventually, Brad Haddin was brought on for the Test series in India, where he failed miserably. The faith in him paid rich dividends as Haddin had some very useful contributions in the Down Under Ashes series in 2013.</p>",

He took 32 wickets in the series, including the first ever Test hat-trick for India.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nPrior to his ascendancy during that series, Harbhajan made his ODI and Test debut in 1998. After a year in action, few noteworthy displays coupled with a suspect bowling action was all that emerged and he was eventually relegated to domestic cricket. His return after a two-year hiatus was a one filled with renewed determination that epitomized captain Sourav Ganguly's fearlessness. Following his stand-out performance against Australia, he forced selectors to rethink India's bowling line-up by opting for a two-pronged spin attack in tandem with Anil Kumble. He added further repute as a player with his pinch-hitting abilities as a tail-ender.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nFollowing spin-ally Kumble's retirement from international cricket, the mantle was cast on The Turbanator (his nickname), especially in series abroad where India usually played with a solitary spinner. He stuck to his task in India's series victory in New Zealand in 2009, the country's first such win against the Kiwis in 40 years. In November 2010, he scaled an unprecedented summit in his batting career when he scored his maiden Test century against New Zealand, helping India to save the match.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn 2011, Harbhajan led the Mumbai franchise in the Champions League and emerged victoriously. However, a poor run of form in international cricket forced him out of the team and he was left out for the home series against West Indies and the tour to Australia later that year. Immediately, the off-spinner went back to basics and improvised in his stint with Essex. He did get a few opportunities to come back but his shoddy performances coupled with the meteoric rise of Ravichandran Ashwin meant that he had a very little opening to become the mainstay again.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAlthough, Harbhajan did make a comeback to the Test side and became the 10th Indian to play 100 Tests when he played against Australia in Chennai. But after that, he was dropped and sent back to the domestic format. An impressive performance for Mumbai in the 2015 Indian T20 League and Harbhajan was called up again for the only Test against Bangladesh that year. In the 2015-16 season, he played a few Tests and some ODIs and also got a chance in the 2016 World T20 squad.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nSince 2016, Harbhajan hasn't played in the national colours in any format and it is very unlikely that he will make a comeback again. Although he has not announced retirement, his career is all but over. In recent years, Harbhajan has become a bowler who has been economical but hasn't been able to pick up wickets consistently. After playing for 10 years with Mumbai, he was released by the franchise and was bought by Chennai in the auction for the 2018 Indian T20 League.</p>",

He was one of those cricketers who possessed talent which can neither be cultivated, nor taught, just practiced. His short bouncers, dippy off-cutters and his most prolific slower deliveries, made him a cult figure in the English audience, but unfortunately his talents were not much appreciated in his home country, Australia. He became the first T20 centurion in 2003 and clubbed two more of them overall.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPicked up as a Twenty20 specialist to play for the Hampshire Hawks in 2008 and the Northamptonshire Steelbacks in 2009, 'Freak' a nickname for him when he was 14, finally moved to Zimbabwe in 2010, where he played first class and T20 for the Southern Rocks.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>",

Hayden’s mental as well as physical strength was something that he used to its optimum on the field. An attacking batsman on the front foot, the Queenslander was a regular member of the slip cordon and made a fine catcher in the gully position. With 8,000 plus Test runs and an average of 50.73, Hayden dismissed all those who never thought of him as more than an ODI specialist. Not to forget, his mammoth innings of 380 against Zimbabwe at Perth was a record in itself. He eventually came well in the One-Day arena as well. However, a brief slump of form during 2004-05 saw him being dropped from the ODI squad, bringing in young Michael Clarke. But, such was his grit and dedication that he bounced back strongly in Tests, surpassing the legendary Sir Donald Bradman in Test centuries. A fractured toe and a broken bone did not stop the run machine from thumping the most number of runs in the 2007 World Cup, which earned him much respect.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut just as all great careers come to an end, Hayden’s too, was no exception. An Achilles injury during the Indian T20 league where he played for Chennai, kept him out of national duties and that saw the decline of one of the most glorious careers in Australia’s cricketing folklore.

He had an excellent season at Grace Road as he bagged 56 first-class wickets at 21.05, which helped him scoop the Players' Player of the Year award and the Cricketer of the Year award. In addition, he became the club's all-time leading wicket-taker in Twenty20 cricket – a terrific achievement for a cricketer of his age. Henderson is also a useful lower-order batsman and his most memorable innings for the Leics came in 2006, when he smashed six sixes, scoring 42 runs off just 16 balls, eventually helping his team to a famous victory.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHaving given so many years of his life to Leicestershire, the Worcester-born veteran definitely deserves much respect and admiration from his teammates, and rightly so, he was named the spin bowling coach of his club in 2007.

He was England's front-line bowler during their tour to India in 2001-02, and had an impressive winter as he bagged 7 wickets against New Zealand at Christchurch. While flashier team mates continued to steal his limelight, Hoggard quietly rose through the ranks. His moment of glory came in the year 2004, when he took a superb hat-trick against the West Indies, followed by a marvelous 12-wicket haul in South Africa that helped England secure a 2-1 lead in the series. He didn't stop there, and in the summer that followed, he contributed with 9 wickets in England's first Ashes victory after 18 years. In the meanwhile, he became an integral part of his county, Yorkshire, who he went on to serve for 14 long years.

But, with too much bowling came gruesome injuries and he was soon sidelined from the team.

Apart from this, Jadeja also held the record for the highest partnership for the fourth and fifth wicket along with Mohammad Azharuddin. Another major achievement was getting 3 wickets for just 3 runs against England at Sharjah to win the match for India.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHis appearances in Test matches though, were limited to just 15 because of his vulnerability to genuine pace and swing bowling. His career came to a screeching halt in 2000 because of a five year ban for match-fixing. Although this was contested, nothing came of it and he was forced to stay away from cricket. This opened doors for a host of other options, like acting. He has made appearances in Indian cinema as well as television shows and continues to be a cricket analyst and commentator to this day.</p>",

In spite of his numerous achievements, he remains the most down-to-earth characters of the game and is an idol for Sri Lankan fans.</p>\r\n<p>Jayawardene captained his school's Under-13 side, playing at the pivotal number three position. With his wonderful, flowing technique and his penchant for big runs, he quickly became one of the most promising players at school level. He made his debut for Sinhalese Sports Club in 1995 and after slamming four centuries in the 1997-98 season, was fast tracked into Sri Lanka's Test squad. He made an impressive debut against India, carving a neat 66-run knock in a game in which Sri Lanka piled a record-breaking 952-6. He made his ODI debut in 1998 and scored a fine 74 in only his second game. However his breakthrough innings was a fluent 167 against New Zealand on a Galle pitch so treacherous that Stephen Fleming labelled it as a 'dung heap'.</p>\r\n<p>Thereafter, Mahela became a regular for Sri Lanka in Tests and ODIs and has been a consistent performer over the years. An artistic 107 against England at Lord's and a double hundred against a decent South African attack at Galle were just some of the highlights of his career during this period. In 2006, he was made captain for Sri Lanka's Bangladesh tour after regular skipper Marvan Atapattu was ruled out with a back injury. He then led a young Sri Lankan side to complete a 5-0 whitewash of England in an ODI series and draw level in the Test series. The fact that it was achieved in England; a country where few Asian countries had succeeded was a testimony to Jayawardene's leadership qualities. After a brief stint with captaincy that included a place in the 2007 World Cup final, he stepped down in 2009 with a view to concentrate on his batting. However, the responsibility returned to him in 2011-12 after he took over from Tillakaratne Dilshan. The skipper tried his best to help Sri Lanka win their maiden World Twenty20 title in 2012 but had to settle with the runners-up position. Following the debacle, Jayawardene relinquished his T20I captaincy, while continuing to captain in Tests and ODIs. He finally stepped down as a leader from all formats of the game in 2013, post the Australia series.</p>\r\n<p>A sweet timer of the ball, Jayawardene is blessed with immaculate technique and loads of patience. Equally adept of both the front and back foot, he is a fine cutter of the ball and a very good close in fielder. A team man to the core, he is credited for developing many of Sri Lanka's youngsters into better cricketers. His versatility to adapt to all forms of the game led him to being bought by Delhi in the fifth edition of the Indian T20 League after having represented Mohali and the now-defunct Kochi in the previous editions.</p>\r\n<p>The maestro called it curtains to his limited overs career after failing to take Sri Lanka past the quarter-final mark in the 2015 ICC World Cup. He had retired from Tests in 2014.</p>",

However, as time passed, he became the most suitable opener Sri Lanka ever produced. He first opened during the Hero Cup in 1993 and went on to cement a firm place in the side. It was his rattling attacks on the bowlers in the 1996 World Cup that proved his potential as a batsman, helping the Islanders clinch their maiden WC title. Later, he crept into the Test side as well and began to display his batting prowess, notching one hundred after the other. Jayasuriya dominated the cover and point region and was an exponent of brilliant hand-eye co-ordination. Just like any other cricketer, he had his own share of lows, but every time critics pointed a finger at him, he would respond with his bat. Also, his astute bowling coupled with his sound batting made him the perfect all-rounder in the game. Soon, captaincy came knocking and it was gladly accepted by Jayasuriya, as he guided his team to a semi-final berth in the 2003 World Cup.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRetirement plans were announced in 2006, only to make a comeback within weeks. Few months later, Jayasuriya hung his whites, whilst continuing to exhibit the coloured clothes. Once again, he was a significant contributor to Sri Lanka’s place in the 2007 CWC final and steered his team to an Asia Cup win in 2008. However, age caught up and he failed to duplicate his magic from the Test and ODI arena to the T20 format, particularly the IPL. He still made it to the 30-man squad for the 2011 CWC, and made a surprise comeback to the ODI side when he was named for the one-day series against England. Immediately, he decided to hang up his boots after the first ODI.</p>",

The selectors awarded him with a chance to make his Test debut and he proved his selection by taking five wickets in the match.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollowing a good show, he was included in the squad to tour the Caribbean Islands but he failed with the bat and also got involved in a controversy after admitting to have smoked marijuana. This was probably the start of the downfall of his career as he was dropped following that incident. The brutal batsmen never got a fair chance to prove his worth with the bat, which is evident from the fact that before getting dropped he was involved in 14 ODIs where he batted just six times, scoring 70 runs. Though, his bowling remained an asset as he claimed 17 wickets during that period.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter spending nearly three years out of the team, Justin Kemp finally returned against England in the home series. He was in no mood to let go that opportunity and he amassed his way back into the side with a few brutal knocks; which included a 36-ball 57 at Cape Town and a quickfire 50-ball 80 at East London, both resulting in South Africa's win. His ODI career kick-started but unfortunately he lost his spot in the Test team after the 2005 tour of Australia.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTagged as a one-day specialist, “Kempie” was looked up by the nation as the next Lance Klusener. He showed glimpses here and there with his aggressive kind of hitting but often lacked consistency. One of his notable performances in one-dayers came against India when he struck his maiden hundred and dragged his side out of misery and single-handedly won them the match.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA flop campaign in 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup followed by an average ICC World Twenty20, led to him getting dropped once again and since then he has found it very tough to make his way back into the side. He also participated in the rebel league in India and in 2010 was signed by Chennai Super Kings. Kemp also gives his services to Cape Cobras in the domestic circuit.</p>",

Only after a year in domestic cricket, he was called up to the national side for the ICC Knockout Trophy in 2000. He made impact right away taking 3 for 48 on his debut. He was handed the Test cap in the very same year and he was among the wickets yet again.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHe formed a good partnership with the likes of Javagal Srinath, Ashish Nehra and was instrumental in India reaching the 2003 World Cup finals. Though it was on the big day that things went awry for him. After a duel with Matthew Hayden, Khan lost the plot and ended up conceding 67 runs in his 7 overs. Many Indian fans still remember and rue the spell till date.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nZaheer signed up with Worcestershire in 2006 as their overseas player. He took as many as 78 wickets for them and showed the world that he still had it in him. It was there where he got the nickname “Zippy Zakky.” A much leaner and fitter Zak was recalled to the international team for India and became a regular for them.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn the Nottingham Test in 2007, after being triggered by the “Jelly Beans” incident, he racked up a five-fer to set up India’s famous win. He was a key figure for his captain MS Dhoni as India scaled new heights. Be it leading the team to the Number 1 ranking in Tests or winning the 2011 World Cup, Zaheer’s contribution cannot be measured by mere numbers.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIt was on the tour to England in 2011 that injury caught up with him again. His absence meant India had no strike bowler and it started their horror run overseas. Zaheer along with Yuvraj Singh, went to France to get back to full fitness. He though had lost the pace and the zing in his bowling to keep going. A string of decent performances followed and in what turned out to be his last Test in 2014, against New Zealand, he took 5 wickets but Brendon McCullum’s triple ton had not just saved the game but also won the series for the Kiwis.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nZaheer ended his Test career with 311 Test wickets, second only to Kapil Dev for India as far as pacers are concerned. He though remained in action in the Indian T20 League. Having started with Bangalore, he was bought by Mumbai for a couple of years in 2009 only to return to the former franchise in 2011. In 2014, he was bought back by Mumbai but he failed to make a mark. He was signed up by Delhi in 2015 and led the revival of Delhi’s bowling. He was named captain for them in 2016 but could not lead them to glory with injuries troubling him again.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nZaheer Khan’s tactical sharpness and mental strength made him stand out among the rest. His four sixes to Henry Olonga in an ODI are a part of folklore. Not to forget his success against Graeme Smith over a period of time that showed he had one of the best cricketing brains. India will hope to make use of his skills somewhere down the line.</p>",

The only thing that distinguished him from others was his calm-headed and determined approach towards the game of cricket. Kirsten&rsquo;s game revolved around his basic strengths and weaknesses and his adaptability to different conditions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKirsten debuted against Australia in Melbourne in 1993 and over the years, proved to be the most organised batsman in the South African dressing room. His ability to concentrate for longer periods saw him becoming the leading South African run-scorer and centurion in Tests, before it was surpassed by Jacques Kallis. His career-best knock of 275 came in 14 and half hours, the second-longest innings in terms of duration in the history of cricket. This happened when South Africa followed on against England at Kingsmead in 1999-00. Later, in 2003, he returned to England to haunt them and in the Headingly Test, scored a crucial 130 that helped South Africa win the Test by 191 runs. Where other batsmen struggled against the turning ball, Kirsten enjoyed particular success in sub-continent conditions. He averaged 52.33 on the Indian soil with a highest score of 133, while the average got even better in Pakistan with a staggering 88.16. In his final Test before retirement from international cricket, he hit a match-winning knock of 76 that helped South Africa win the match and level the series against New Zealand in 2004.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPost retirement, he was the batting consultant of the Warriors for some time and later, in 2006, he set up his own Cricket Academy in Cape Town. In 2008, he was elected to coach the Indian cricket team and over the next two years, changed the fortunes of the team. A patient person, Kirsten&rsquo;s personality was often reflected off-the-field when he mentored the Indian team. Under him, India did extremely well as they gradually scaled the No.1 rank in Test cricket. The biggest fruit of his efforts were reaped in 2011, when the Indian team won the ICC Cricket World Cup. In skipper MS Dhoni&rsquo;s words, Kirsten was &ldquo;the best thing to happen to Indian cricket&rdquo;. The World Cup was his final assignment with the Indian team and thereafter, Kirsten denied continuing as the coach owing to family commitments. He was later named coach of the South African national team in 2011.</p>",

Being India's most effective bowler in both Tests and ODIs, Kumble spearheaded the Indian bowling attack for more than a decade. Most remembered for being an out-and-out team man, he has been one of the greatest spinners to have ever played the game.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn a spectacular yet downplayed career, “Jumbo” claimed practically every Indian bowling record. Never a great turner of the ball, he always extracted enough from the surface to fox the batsmen with his consistent line and length. His googly, side spin and subtle variations in flight caused trouble for the batsmen. In 1999, he became the second bowler ever to scalp ten wickets in a Test innings, a feat first achieved by Jim Laker. Kumble's phenomenal ability to stomach pain was proved in Antigua in 2002 when he bandaged his fractured jaw and returned to the field to deliver a stirring spell. The leg-spinner received the ultimate gift in the twilight of his career after he was named India's Test skipper in 2007, following which he delivered India's first win against Pakistan at home in 27 years.<br />\r\n </p>\r\n<p>A career spanning 18 long and glorious years, Kumble played 132 Tests and 271 ODIs, picking 619 wickets in the former, while claiming 337 in the latter. The veteran bowler retired as the third highest wicket-taker in Tests, behind legends Muttiah Muralidaran and Shane Warne. His retirement from international cricket, however, didn't stop him from participating in the Indian Premier League in 2008. He led the Bangalore franchise in 2009 and afterwards took on the mentoring role. In 2013, Kumble shifted allegiance to Mumbai as chief mentor.<br />\r\n </p>\r\n<p>After those management stints in the Indian T20 League, he joined the International Cricket Council's Cricket Committee in 2012.

His time with the Australian cricket team was testament to this statement as Langer went from strength to strength helping his team to being the most dominant in world cricket.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLanger made an impression on debut scoring a defiant 54 against West Indies in 1993 and yet saw his team go down by only one run. His innings will be remembered for the fact that Ian Bishop got one to bounce of his helmet. This did not deter him though and he fought on to defy the imposing West Indian quicks. In 1999-2000, in partnership with Adam Gilchrist, he went on to score 122 runs and somehow rescued Australia from an almost impossible situation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNicknamed Alfies and JL, Langer was known for his exquisite drives and cuts. He was one half of the formidable opening partnership for Australia along with the dashing Matthew Hayden. Together, both of them set out breaking records and giving their team platforms on which to base their scores. While one half of the partnership (Hayden) bludgeoned his way around the field, Langer would graft his innings with proper cricket shots according to the situation. The two of them were the perfect foil for each other.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLanger achieved a rare feat in the Perth Test of 2004 against Pakistan. He outscored the entire Pakistan team in both innings scoring 191 and 97 in the first and second innings respectively while Pakistan only managed 179 and 72. Additionally, this was the first instance of a batsman getting out in the 190’s and 90’s in the same match. He went on to become the most successful Aussie batsman in the Ashes the following year scoring 391 runs while the rest of the team was woeful. In 2006, when Langer was out through injury, he was replaced with Mike Hussey and Phil Jaques. The Ashes in 2007 turned out to be his last as he began to suffer from a number of injuries. He finally announced his retirement in 2007.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2009, Langer surpassed Sir Don Bradman as the leading Aussie first-class run scorer when he scored his 86th century. He retired from all forms of cricket the following year. Post retirement, Langer took up the position of Australia’s assistant coach, under Tim Nielsen.</p>",

Appearances for Langeveldt have largely been in limited overs, but he has seen more highlights than what some of his fellow countrymen experience over an entire International career. His second ODI against Kenya provided Langeveldt his first moment of reckoning, with figures of 4/21 helping South Africa to one of their largest ODI wins. In 2005, on being called up to the Test side to visiting England, Langeveldt took a 5-for on debut to again lead the Proteas to a resounding victory. His first ODI five-for came at one of his favourite soils at the Caribbean, where figures of 5/62 defeated West Indies by a dramatic single run. An unlikely hat trick off the final over by Langeveldt completely turned the tides and provided ODI cricket with one of its best matches.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn between, he played a solitary game in the 2003 World Cup that ended in disappointment for hosts South Africa. They did bounce back four years hence in 2007, with Langeveldt among the team’s bowling spearheads.

As if to prove that this was not a fluke, he followed it up with an unbeaten 501 in a first class match for Warwickshire the following season.

But its larger impact was instilling a previously unfound belief and character which the Indian team lacked for decades, paving the way to inspire awe which a nation of fans often demanded but were sparsely supplied with.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nYet, Laxman’s career transcends that single historic knock. His extensive wrist-work after leaning into a delivery while cushioning the ball with confidence never seemed laboured even in bowler-friendly conditions of Australia, New Zealand and the West Indies. For a large part, VVS was a constant feature in the Indian Test side, along with Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n“Lachu Bhai” as he is famously called, scored 17 Test tons, way behind Tendulkar and Dravid, but most of those centuries packed a punch. Proficient against fast bowling as well as spin, Laxman scripted many Test wins for India. His ability to bat with tail-enders was second to none. An example of which was seen in the win over Australia in Mohali in 2010. Suffering from back spasms, he along with Suresh Raina (his runner) and nervy Pragyan Ojha, saw India home in a tense finish.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>Laxman made his ODI debut in 1998 against Zimbabwe and was out for a three-ball duck to Pommie Mbangwa. He got plenty of starts but could not make the most of them. Out of his six centuries in colored clothing, three of them came in four games in the VB series in Australia in 2004 and that was it. He struggled to cope with the increasing demands of the 50-overs format and was eventually dropped from the side in favour of youngsters. One of the few regrets that he would have despite having a decade long career is that he did not feature in a single World Cup campaign for India.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>VVS enjoyed playing the Australians in the longest format of the game, scoring 6 of his 17 tons against them. He suffered a dip in form and after two back-to-back poor series in England and Australia in 2011-12, questions were being asked about his place in the side. He announced his retirement days after being picked for the New Zealand series in 2012.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>Laxman tried his luck in the Indian T20 League but did not have much success.

Lehmann reached the landmark of playing more first-class games and scoring more runs than any other Australian before making his Test debut, until Michael Hussey surpassed it.

After a tumultuous career ride, Lehmann retired from international cricket in 2007.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPost retirement, Lehmann participated in the Indian T20 league and represented Rajasthan. Later, he took up coaching and was named head coach of Hyderabad in the 2009 edition and he continued till 2012 before moving onto coach Punjab. 16 days prior to the start of the 2013 Ashes in England, Darren Lehmann was appointed as the coach of the Australian side, replacing Mickey Arthur.</p>",

Martin got his first taste of international cricket in the year 2000 in a Test match against South Africa. His talent was unravelled immediately as he struck three lusty blows picking up the wickets of Kirsten, McKenzie and Pollock. He picked up his first 5-wicket haul against Zimbabwe in a Test at Wellington in 2000. A series of injuries kept Bond out of the side and elevated Martin as the No.1 choice for the Kiwi pace department.

His clumsy batting has often been the highlight, which has also resulted in him making more Test ducks than any other New Zealander.</p>",

Martyn was considered to be one of the classiest batsmen of his era and made batting look much uncomplicated. He was a promising talent for the Aussies but living the glamorous life affected his career. Following his defensive approach, he was dropped from the national side.

He played with a high elbow and high head and was one of the best reverse sweepers in the game.

A magnificent 13-month streak saw him scoring over 1600 runs and bagging two man-of the-series awards.

Later, he became instrumental in Australia&rsquo;s first Champions Trophy success, following which his career began to decline.

However, from 2004 onwards, a steady improvement in the batting charts not only saw him establish himself in ODIs but also inspired confidence in the selectors to give him a break in Test cricket. In his first Test against South Africa, McCullum went on to score 57 in the first innings. He scored his maiden Test hundred against Bangladesh in only his seventh Test and came up with a few more good knocks but as has been the general trend for wicket-keepers, continued to be wasted in the middle order.</p>\r\n<p>McCullum's luck changed following the 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup, when Daniel Vettori took over the captaincy from Stephen Fleming. Vettori wasted no time in promoting McCullum to the top of the order and he returned his captain's favour with knocks of 81 and 96 against South Africa and Australia respectively. The inaugural season of the Indian T20 League was set alight with his breath-taking unbeaten 158, setting high standards for the remainder of the tournament. In 2009, he had notched up four consecutive fifties in T20Is, one each against West Indies and Australia and two against India.</p>\r\n<p>An acrobatic keeper improving over time, McCullum gave up on his wicket-keeping in Tests to concentrate on batting but still remained sharp and safe in the outfield. In 2012, he was handed over the captaincy role, taking over from Ross Taylor after the latter had a fall-out with the team management. McCullum has faced a chronic back issue that has resurfaced from time to time. During West Indies' tour to New Zealand in 2013, McCullum decided to give up keeping to prolong his career as a batsman, being the senior-most member of the team and a very important batsman. In the Test series against India at home in 2014, Brendon McCullum notched up a triple century, becoming the first ever Kiwi to do so. Featuring in the Indian T20 league since its inception, Baz was signed up by Chennai in the 7th season, after representing his former club, Kolkata previously.</p>\r\n<p>The 2015 ICC World Cup was the pinnacle in his ODI career.

However, with Craig McDermott retiring from international cricket due to injuries, McGrath stepped into his big boots with consummate ease, and for more than a decade after that troubled the batsmen world over with his unerring accuracy and bounce from good length areas. Arguably the best fast bowler of his time, surpassing the great Courtney Walsh's 519, he went on to eventually take 563 wickets in Test cricket.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIt was his simple approach to the wicket, and a high arm action that helped McGrath derive the maximum anyone could, and also prevented him from having any serious injuries throughout his career, something that all fast bowlers face in their careers. However, McGrath’s greatness is not just restricted to his tally of wickets or the measly average, but his ability to psyche out opponents by targeting opposition batsmen before the match and following his words to the exact tee! Despite being a weak link with the bat, his determination and guts enabled him to make 61, which was the highest for a No.11 in Tests at that time.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nMichael Atherton can be safely named as McGrath’s bunny, having got dismissed 19 times by the lanky fast bowler, however, as McGrath’s bowling averages of 21 and 22 in Tests and ODIs respectively show, not many batsmen world over were able to collar the bowler on too many occasions. Small measure then, he has scalped a total of 949 international wickets. He ended his Test career as the third highest Test wicket-taker, but has been overtaken since.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n\"Pigeon\" as he was so widely known, because of his sleek and long legs, was written off a few times in his career - Once when he was coming back from an ankle injury in 2004 and then two years later, when his wife Jane had cancer which required his full attention. But McGrath wasn't the one to let anybody tell him when to call it quits. After missing out for the most part of the 2005 Ashes due to injury, the tall pacer was determined to avenge that which he did in 2007 as Australia whitewashed England. He retired from the longest format after that. Later that year, he was the Man of the Tournament in his side's World Cup winning campaign with 26 wickets, after which he hung his boots from the 50-over format as well and thereby, bid farewell to international cricket on a high. McGrath was then a regular feature in the Delhi setup and represented the franchise for the first three editions of the Indian T20 League, starting 2008.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nGlenn Donald McGrath went on to be a superb character off the field post his retirement. After losing his wife to breast cancer, he started raising money and spreading awareness about the disease through the McGrath Foundation which was started in 2005 after Jane's initial diagnosis. Every January, the 3rd Day of the Sydney Test turns into a sea of pink in honour of Jane McGrath and it is celebrated as Jane McGrath Day. A champion on and off the field, you'd expect nothing else from the legend.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Time and again, injuries had been the single largest stumbling block in the career of Kiwi speedster Kyle Mills. But it was laudable that his performances had not been affected by his niggles and he emerged as one of the most established bowlers in the Kiwi side.</p>\r\n<p>After debuting for Auckland in 1998, Mills switched loyalties to Lincolnshire in 2001 and in the same year made his ODI debut against Pakistan. Over the next two years, he made fleeting appearances in ODIs including the 2003 World Cup, where he played a solitary game. Mills got his first break in Test cricket in 2004 but his debut proved to be a totally forgettable outing with a side strain ruling him out of the remaining tour. His ODI career was however going great guns with the 2005-06 season yielding 19 wickets which included a memorable 4-44 against South Africa at Cape Town.</p>\r\n<p>An injury prior to the 2007 World Cup ruled him out of the event but his agony refused to cede even after a long rehabilitation as a stomach bug ruled him out of a Test against South Africa in 2007. But Mills buried his injury demons against the Africans in the following ODI series scalping 8 wickets which included his first five-wicket haul. Mills played in the inaugural season for the Punjab franchise in the Indian T20 League and an inspiring performance in the Chappell-Hadlee series in early 2009 saw him reach the top of the ODI rankings. He also played a major role in New Zealand's 2009 World Twenty20 campaign and starred in the following ICC Champions Trophy where the Black Caps reached the tournament's final.</p>\r\n<p>In November 2009, he needed a surgery on his shoulder as well as his knee and that forced him out of action. Another spate of injuries followed in 2010 and 2011 forcing him out of action for most part of these years. In 2013, Mills was appointed as ODI captain for the Lankan limited-overs tour, after the Kiwis suffered a whitewash at the hands of Bangladesh.</p>\r\n<p>He missed most of the action in 2014 and 2015 and finally, when, in spite of being a part of the Kiwi World Cup squad, he struggled to get a single game, the pacer decided to call it quits to his international career.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Very rarely will you find a batsman who can adapt to all forms of cricket, on all kinds of surfaces, against any type of attack thrown at him with consummate ease. Misbah-ul-Haq, a household hero in Pakistan today, has been one of the brighter stars of Pakistan's cricket in the second half of the first decade at the turn of the millennium during which most of the players turned into black holes or dying stars for Pakistan.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMisbah-ul-Haq came into prominence in the 2007 World Twenty20 when he nearly led Pakistan to an improbable victory over arch rivals India in the tournament's final. If it wasn't for the mistimed scoop shot, the World Cup could have well been Pakistan's.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt 33, many cricketers are at the fag end of their careers. However, for Misbah, it was just the start. Many argued that his presence earlier would have given much solidity to a batting order filled with youngsters who had a tendency to be brash. But few remember that in early 2000, Misbah had his opportunities both in Tests and ODIs, and was only dropped after he failed to muster up decent scores even after being granted numerous opportunities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite continuing to score prolifically in the domestic circuit, selectors felt that he had used up his chances and there seemed no way back for the right-hander. But on the eve of the 2007 World Twenty20, the selectors did a U-turn and Misbah repaid their faith with a stellar campaign. His performances won him places both in the Test and ODI arena and he continued his rich vein of form with a fine 2007 tour to India where he scored hundreds in back-to-back Tests. In ODIs, he had a successful series in 2008 against West Indies and also led Pakistan to victory in a game against the Aussies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn late 2010, following Salman Butt's dismissal for the match fixing controversy and with Afridi's reluctance to take up the post, Misbah was handed Pakistan's Test captaincy reins. ODI captaincy followed post the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup after Shahid Afridi relinquished his leadership. Misbah was also eventually handed the Twenty20 captaincy, which he gave up in 2012. One of his biggest achievements as a captain came in 2012 when he powered Pakistan to a 3-0 clean sweep over England in the Test series in the UAE and then went on to guide Pakistan to an ODI series win over India in India.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMisbah-ul-Haq represented Bangalore in the inaugural version of the Indian T20 League until Pakistani players went out of contention in the following editions due to political tension between the two countries. With age, Misbah got even better and his fitness stood by him all through. In 2011, Misbah averaged more than 60 in Tests and over 50s in the ODIs. In 2013, when Pakistan's batting woes reached a crescendo, Misbah, an MBA graduate, was a stand-out, scoring over 1000 runs in the calendar year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2014-15 was a difficult period for Pakistan and Misbah, unable to register victories consistently. He had his last laugh, taking Pakistan to the quarters of the 2015 ICC World Cup, where he came up against a dominant Aussie side. The skipper finally called it quits from ODIs after his side's exit from the mega event. Apart from the despair of failing to win the 2007 ICC WT20, the only other sorrow in Misbah's heart would be his not scoring a single ODI ton. He ended his ODI career with a best of 96 not out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce having been a T20I skipper, Misbah failed to find a place in the Pakistan T20I side post 2012. However, he has not given up and continues to hope to be selected in the shortest version. Currently, his experiences are utilized in the Tests.</p>",

However, things fell apart.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe right handed batsman made his Test debut in 2001 against Sri Lanka and showcased his talent with immediate effect by scoring a delightful century. His run of form deteriorated after that knock though, and he was subsequently dropped from the squad for the series against England at home. Ashraful fought back and made it to the squad in 2004 and did not stop there. In a game against India at Chittagong, the young talent went on to score an unbeaten 158. The man from Dhaka sealed his place as a future talent when he scored a composed century against Australia in a tri-series in England to help his side win that encounter. His lack of patience and ability to convert starts into big knocks cost him his place in the side yet again, but as always he bounced back by scoring heaps of runs in the domestic circuit. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2007, Ashraful was named Bangladesh’s captain. However, he didn’t enjoy captaincy too much as he couldn’t lead the side to a single Test win. The selectors eventually relieved Ashraful off the captaincy reins and it turned out to be a move for the better as the man continued to showcase his talent with the bat.</p>",

Known for his ability to turn the ball on any given surface and his continuous enthusiasm for the game, Muttiah Muralidaran was quickly nicknamed the “smiling assassin”.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“Murali” broke into the scheme of things in 1992 in a Test against Australia where he picked up wickets of batsmen of the repertoire of Mark Waugh and Tom Moody, and also featured in the 1996 world cup winning side.

The maestro continued his brilliance with the ball as he took 6 for 87 and 7 for 84 against South Africa at Galle in the year 2000 dismissing all eleven batsmen over two innings.

The action has been bitter-sweet for the off-spinner making him susceptible to allegations of bowling with an illegal action and reaping rewards in the form of 800 Test wickets. Murali’s delivery the ‘doosra’, the one that doesn’t turn but goes straight on is one of the biggest reasons for his overall success as a bowler and has been his weapon of mass destruction. Following the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup, he announced his retirement from international cricket. He has plied his trade for all the domestic T20 leagues worldwide and remains a hot property till date. Muralidaran was then signed by the Bangalore for the fifth season and they retained him in the seventh season. Muralidaran was also a part of the now-defunct Kochi team previously.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Few bowlers can be as ordinary and unplayable in equal measure as Ashish Nehra. A left-arm seamer with a side-on action, the Delhi-born player is gifted with pace and swing. His earliest taste of international cricket came in 1999 against Sri Lanka in a one-off Test appearance that resulted in a draw. He returned to the fold after a couple of years, during India's tour of Zimbabwe, playing all of the two Tests and five ODIs. In Tests though, Nehra failed to achieve notable breakthroughs as a front-line seamer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe continued to be a part of the setup until 2005, featuring in India's 2003 World Cup final run and the side’s respectable showing in Australia at the Border-Gavaskar Trophy the same year. Yet, under the hood, it became clear that Nehra's inclusion was only a stop-gap arrangement until Irfan Pathan and Zaheer Khan became accomplished and by year end, that left-arm pairing became consistent enough to replace Nehra.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor four years, there was no talk of Nehra before he earned a surprise call-up in 2009 to tour the West Indies. Still it seemed his inconsistencies hadn't been ironed out, but as a strike bowler his knack of taking wickets saw an upswing. Regular 3-fors and 4-fors, along with injuries to the young breed kept Nehra's slot until 2010.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNehra was named in the 15-member Indian squad for the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup, but missed out on most of the matches. He received a lot of flak for a poor final over in the match against South Africa in the league stage which India lost, and was dropped. However, given his experience, he was recalled into the playing eleven for the crucial semi-final against Pakistan where he put up a decent performance. In 2012, he was signed by Pune for the fifth edition of the lucrative Indian T20 league. The following year, Delhi bought him for the sixth edition before Chennai bagged him in the next season. Although, he enjoyed his most fruitful season with Sunrisers Hyderabad in 2016-17. </p>\r\n<p>With age catching up and his body going through a lot of stress, the Delhi speedster called it quits from all form of cricket. He was handed a heartfelt farewell at his home ground by the BCCI in the first match of the 3-T20I series against New Zealand in 2017. To put his career in a nutshell, Nehra had a lot of potential but due to injuries, he underachieved.</p>",

        "description": "<p>One of the most symbolic fixtures for cricket fans at the turn of the millennium was the three-pronged South African attack involving legends Allan Donald and Shaun Pollock, along with the emerging force of Makhaya Ntini. The triplets combined to make the Proteas one of the most varied and devastating bowling attacks in its time. As the apprentice in the group, Ntini was often deployed as first change. A first glimpse was provided in his debut against Sri Lanka in 1998 where his first inning yielded 1/57 from 10 overs, while his second recorded immediate improvement with a 1/17 from 6.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRunning with a focused run-up, using the full width of the pitch, Ntini created as much angle to bowl his trademark inswingers that attacked the batsman. He functioned on the basic you miss, I hit principle. When later promoted to open the bowling with Pollock, it proved to be the right mix; Ntini’s attacking style and the Pollock’s patient tenacity, never allowing batsmen to settle into a frame of mind. As Makhaya progressed through the ranks, he quickly learnt the containment side of bowling and added economy to his spells. With historic wicket-hauls to constantly earn his backing, Ntini remained with the team for up to 9 years, overseeing retirements of Donald and Pollock and forming a bowling partnership with the promising Dale Steyn.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNtini’s most memorable displays were at Lord’s in 2003, when he took 5 wickets in each inning to burden England with an innings defeat. Two years hence, he bettered that 10 wicket haul with a 13/132 against West Indies in Port of Spain. A year later, in 2006, his 6/22 against Australia at home thumped the Aussies to a record ODI defeat. In 2009, during Ntini’s lowest runs of form, he featured in his centenary Test outing against England at Centurion. It was a grand moment for the Proteas, celebrating a player who is one of the best ambassadors of sport for post-Apartheid South Africa.</p>",

He made an impact when he returned to the ODI and Test sides in 2002-03, after a foot injury; but was constantly in and out of the national team over the years.

Later that year, Oram was released from his central contract by New Zealand Cricket early after he expressed his decision to discontinue representing his country at the international level.

        "description": "<p>Easily among the finest players to have graced the game, Ricky Ponting was the proper definition of a typical Australian - aggressive, in-your-face and a man with immense self-belief. Academy coach Rod Marsh once described Ponting as the greatest teenage batsman that he had ever coached. Having made his first-class debut at a tender age of 17, 'Punter' as he is fondly called, got blooded into the Australian national side in 1995 as a 20-year old. He had a fairly good start to his ODI career that saw him getting drafted into the Test squad the same year. Ponting was unlucky to miss out on a century on debut in the five-day format but he had announced himself well to the cricketing world.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn his initial years, Ponting batted more as a middle order batsman before moving into the iconic number three slot that he made his own. There is no denying the fact that he had disciplinary issues early in the career but as he aged, Punter started maturing gracefully. It's from the year 2002 that his career spiked upwards in a drastic fashion, having been appointed captain in ODIs. It was an extraordinary purple patch that saw him rack up runs in superhuman manner. From Jan 2002-Dec 2003, Ponting blasted 18 international centuries in just 92 innings. He seemed to enjoy the leadership role and loved to lead by example. Subsequently, he got the Test captaincy as well.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHis transformation from a very good batsman to the elite league coincided with Australia's golden period during which they proved invincible across formats. Ponting's maiden World Cup as captain ended in glory for the Australians with him rattling up a blistering century in the Cup final as his side outclassed India to successfully defend the trophy. What made the title win stand out was the fact that the Aussies were unbeaten throughout the tournament - a feat that they would repeat in 2007 as well - to make it a hat-trick of titles. Having an excellent set of players definitely helped Ponting's cause as a captain but his impact as a leader wasn't any lesser.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIt seemed that Ponting relished captaining in the 50-over format more than in Tests where he did have some difficult moments, including three Ashes series defeats while also suffering series defeats to India and South Africa during his tenure. The shorter format suited Ponting's tactics a lot more than the five-day format where he often relied on the experience of his bowlers to pull the side through. Nevertheless, he had immaculate success as captain in both formats as the Aussie juggernaut rolled on in the 2000s. Apart from the World Cup titles, Ponting's Australian team also won consecutive Champions Trophy silverware in 2006 and 2009.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIt won't be wrong to say that Australia's dominance in world cricket halted towards the later years of Ponting's captaincy. The Ashes series defeats and the quarterfinal exit from the 2011 World Cup were signs that the Aussies weren't the dominant force they used to be. While the home Ashes loss saw Ponting's Test captaincy coming to an end in slightly controversial fashion, he himself chose to give up the role in ODIs after the World Cup. His last year in international cricket was a bit of struggle although two centuries (including a double ton) and three fifties against India boosted his statistics a bit. He retired from the longer format in the home series against South Africa in 2012 after having been dropped from ODIs earlier in the year. He played just two games in the 50-over format after leaving captaincy.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nEven after international retirement, Ponting continued to be active in the domestic circuit, topping the subsequent Australian season. He then moved to Surrey for a County stint and racked up a club record for the highest score on debut. A flamboyant shot-maker with almost all the strokes in the book, it were Ponting's pull and hook shots that went on to be his signature strokes. At the time of his retirement, he ended with over 27000 international runs and 71 centuries - second only to Sachin Tendulkar by both yardstick. As a captain and player, he went on to set innumerable records, several of which will be extremely tough if not impossible to better in the coming years.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>He didn't have too much success with franchise leagues although he was part of the 2013 Mumbai squad that won the Indian T20 League. He then became the head coach of the franchise and under his guidance, they registered their second title in 2015. Although not officially a part of their staff now, Ponting still involves himself with the team. A premier batsman, successful leader and an exceptional fielder, the only thing that Ponting couldn't ace was probably bowling which he didn't care much about. His fielding was a delight to witness as he threw himself around the field with aplomb. Fair to say that he was an invaluable asset to Australia and a key member during their dominant era.</p>",

During the 1997-98 Test series vs West Indies he scored 154 in the 5th Test which was his first Test hundred, and that guaranteed him an England selection for next few seasons.

Thilan Samaraweera learnt his lessons quickly and from being an off-spinner who could bat a bit, he transformed himself into a genuine front-line batsman.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt wasn’t easy though. Samaraweera debuted for Colts Cricket Club in 1995 and played as their front-line spinner. He got his due when he was called up to Sri Lanka’s ODI team in 1998. He managed to play only six matches between 1998 and 1999 and was consequently dropped. The presence of Kumar Dharmasena and the wily Murali meant that Samaraweera would find it very hard to break into the Sri Lankan team as a spinner. So he went back to domestic cricket and worked on his batting. The move paid dividends as he made his debut against India at Colombo. Coming in at number eight, Samaraweera combined with Hashan Tillakaratne to put up a mammoth score of 610, and completed his maiden ton in the process.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSamaraweera’s performances were thereafter consistent and he cemented himself in Sri Lanka’s Test squad. However the selectors ignored him in ODIs and he was labeled as a Test specialist. He performed exceedingly well in Tests and it was not until mid-2006, that cracks started appearing in his batting. His ODI career hasn’t rhymed the same way though. After being ignored in the past decade, Kumar Sangakkara gave the veteran a vote of confidence and since 2009, Samaraweera started featuring in ODIs. However coming lower down the order, he has had limited opportunities and his inability to hit big shots may be his undoing in the shorter format of the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSamaraweera may not be as pretty to watch as a Mahela Jayawardena or a Kumar Sangakkara but his ability to wear down bowlers and accumulate runs is an ideal foil to a batting line-up replete with stroke makers. He is also a very good player of spin bowling and is a decent fielder.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2013, Samaweera retired from international cricket after being left out of the Test squad for Sri Lanka’s home series against Bangladesh.<br />\r\n </p>",

        "description": "<p>'Sanga' as he is known to his team-mates, is one of cricket's most endearing personalities both on and off the field and Sri Lankan Cricket would be pleased to have nurtured him into one of the best cricketers of the nation. As a batsman, Sangakkara is a connoisseur's delight. He is a good player of both fast and spin bowling and is known to revel in arduous situations. Sanga has amazing levels of concentration and is known to score big once he reaches a hundred. With the experience of playing under several captains during his career, he has displayed great maturity while leading his side and is known to back youngsters to the hilt. His multilingual abilities also make him a hit in the diverse Sri Lankan dressing room.</p>\r\n<p>Kumar Sangakkara got underway purely as a batsman but subsequently started keeping wickets as well. He made his domestic debut for Nondescripts at the age of 20 and was a consistent performer in the domestic circuit. As a youngster, Sangakkara was gifted with exemplary temperament and was highly rated for his elegant batting. He first came into limelight when he scored a brilliant 156* for Sri Lanka A against Zimbabwe A in a List A match in 2000 and that paved the way for his selection in the national side as he was handed his ODI debut for Sri Lanka in 2000 against Pakistan in a triangular tournament which involved South Africa. He straightaway shone in just his second match as he scored 85 and was named the Man of the Match. A brilliant debut series saw him average 66.33 and end up with seven dismissals with the gloves.</p>\r\n<p>His performances were rewarded with a Test call-up against South Africa, a series in which he performed admirably behind the stumps. After a couple of</p>\r\n<p>nervous nineties, he finally notched up his first Test century against India at Galle in 2001. With a string of impressive performances in Tests and ODIs,</p>\r\n<p>Sangakkara gradually displaced one of Sri Lanka’s greatest wicket-keepers, Romesh Kaluwitharana and cemented his place in Sri Lanka’s squad. His splendid double century against Pakistan at Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore helped Sri Lanka win the 2001/02 Asian Test Championship. Another match-winning double century in Colombo in 2004 powered Sri Lanka to their first ever Test series win over South Africa. His ability to score monstrous tons was on display yet again as he along with Mahela Jayawardene broke all kinds of records with a partnership of 624 runs at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground in Colombo in 2006. Sangakkara fell just 13 short of a triple hundred as Sri Lanka hammered South Africa by an innings and 153 runs. The double centuries flew thick and fast and he replaced Mahela Jayawardene as Sri Lankan skipper in all the three formats in 2009. He gave up his wicket-keeping duties in the Test arena to concentrate on batting later that year. Sanga gave up his captaincy from all formats of the game after Sri Lanka's loss in the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup final against India. He became the joint-fastest batsman to get to the 10,000-run mark in Tests at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, in 2012 and was named the ICC ODI player of the year in 2013.</p>\r\n<p>The 2014-15 season saw him hit a purple patch, as he scored runs and centuries at will. He extended this form into the 2015 ICC World Cup as well, becoming the first player ever to score 4 centuries on the trot. However, his golden run could not quite help him in the quarter-final against South Africa as Sri Lanka crumbled to a heavy defeat. Subsequently, Sangakkara announced his retirement from limited overs cricket.</p>",

Sarwan had a marvelous series against the Proteas in 2003-04, where he averaged almost 100 runs a Test. He had a consistent run of high scores against Bangladesh and low scores against England. A berth in the NatWest Series final followed by a win in the ICC Champions Trophy, were two of the strongest examples of the Guyanese player’s contribution to his team. Just like any other cricketer, Sarwan too, went through a lean patch with injuries and bad form that kept him out of action for a long time. However, the World Cup that followed was a golden opportunity and he grabbed it with both hands, scoring some wonderful performances. Captaincy followed as Brian Lara retired, but Sarwan still made limited appearances in 2007. Upon his return in 2008, he was demoted to the vice-captain’s post as Gayle became the new skipper, but that did not deter him from shining in his brilliant form.</p>",

Afridi can easily be considered as Pakistan's most attention-drawing cricketers right from the time his career got underway.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn his very first innings in ODI cricket, Afridi broke Sanath Jayasuriya's record, scoring the then fastest ODI century off just 37 balls. The feat's shocking nature was underlined by his inclusion as a leg-spinner replacing the injured Mushtaq Ahmed, with only a penchant for fearless pinch-hitting. It was enough batting prowess for him to feature one-down in a Pakistani middle order comprising of stalwarts and experienced players like Ramiz Raja, Ejaz Ahmed and Saleem Malik. He was merely a 16-year old lad and that performance quickly shifted focus from his bowling to willow-accompanying wonders. Soon, he was regarded as a batsman used as a part-time bowler. The change of roles had a reverse effect, forcing Afridi to earn his spot in a specialization he wasn't completely acquainted with.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHe made his Test debut in 1998, taking a five-for in Karachi against Australia. As his career progressed, priorities again reshuffled and with the retirement of spin duo Saqlain Mushtaq and Mushtaq Ahmed by 2004, Afridi and Danish Kaneria became the first-choice spinners. While a limited-overs regular, he remained in and out of Test reckoning. In 2006, he announced his Test retirement opting to focus on ODIs, but came out of it within months. As T20 ushered a limited-overs revolution, Afridi soon became the format's best player internationally, with an appearance in the final of the inaugural edition in 2007 and a win in the subsequent edition, in 2009, as captain, when he scored an unbeaten 54 to take Pakistan to the title. In 2010, he was appointed as captain of Pakistan in all three formats. He successfully led Pakistan to a World Twenty20 semi-final berth. After facing defeat in his first Test as captain, against Australia, Afridi soon proclaimed his re-retirement from Tests.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAfridi was removed as Pakistan's captain on 19th May, 2011, after hinting at disharmony within the team management. Ten days after being sacked as the one-day captain, he announced his retirement from international cricket, only to take it back a few months later. Afridi's dramatics on and off the field earned him both friends and foes in the Pakistani cricketing circles. Afridi soon turned into the king of comebacks, proving each time that he was far from reaching the twilight of his career.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nFailure in the 2014-15 season saw Shahid Afridi announce his retirement again from all forms of cricket post the 2015 ICC World Cup. Whatever way Afridi chooses to leave cricket, he will remain an enigmatic figure among fans and followers of cricket around the world.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Towards the late 90’s, ever since the speedometer grew in prominence, tracking bowling speeds shifted from being another statistical feature to an obsession that added marvel to a seamer’s repute. It tempted a generation of speedsters to topple what was long believed to be Jeff Thomson’s standing record of a 99.9 Mph delivery. Only two candidates emerged from that rat race, Thompson’s Australian compatriot Brett Lee and before him, a Pakistani, later dubbed as ‘’The Rawalpindi Express’’, Shoaib Akhtar.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRunning in like a sprinter, freckles protruding focused eyes that sought a solitary purpose of hitting the deck hard as possible to shock his batting nemesis by sheer speed, and dismantle the erect stumps, Shoaib guards into multiple pieces. It successfully startled many, as few had experienced ball movement that rapid. It either unsettled batsmen or even a fortuitous knick had enough to sneak a boundary. Old school swing was very much second-fiddle. Here was cricket’s rebel. It kept audiences glued as he had carved himself a novelty in cricket. That novelty’s zenith came earlier than many realized, at the 1999 Cricket World Cup in England. Then, a mere year into his international career, Shoaib accompanied captain Wasim Akram to lead Pakistan’s bowling attack, succeeding a retired Waqar Younis. Many were still coping to comprehend an enigma, as he gained enough leverage to be among the tournament’s top wicket-takers. The novelty slowly wore off, though. It also took its toll on his body, with Shoaib’s bones and ligaments undergoing severe wear and tear. It directly affected his speeds. Brett Lee’s emergence no longer made Shoaib’s style one of-a-kind, as neither could dominate world cricket, but only rehash their fear-factors from time to time by honing variation skills getting bulk wickets over odd matches. Batsmen soon became cultured sloggers; in a game which itself transitioned more in their favour.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLarge layoffs owing to injuries snubbed efforts to rebuild his career, increasing frustration. Companionship was sought with controversies, from performance-enhancing & recreational drugs, to a run-in with teammate Mohammad Asif. Under-the-hood, WADA suspicions grew which the PCB did best to protect Akhtar from. Bans were dished, appealed against and overturned. Successful returns in the IPL and limited-over Internationals reinvigorated fanfare. A larger picture, beyond speed (wickets), always felt needful. Akhtar did go onto break Thompson’s record. At what price, few would know.</p>",

Though, that was exactly what happened years later.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA right-arm medium-fast bowler, “Rajib” as he is known, first played for his country at the 2004 Under-19 World Cup, from where he was quickly called up to represented the “A” side, as he showed good signs of a promising speedster. Aggressive while bowling, he can swing the ball both ways and has all the qualities of a highly successful seam bowler. A smooth run-up and an open-chested delivery position characterize his bowling. Despite all this, he had a terrible Test debut that came against England at Lord's in 2005, as he was struck for 101 runs in 12 overs. However, on Bangladesh's second tour in 2010, Shahadat found redemption as he registered a five-wicket haul in the first Test at the same venue. He has been relatively inconsistent on the ODI front, and has hence failed to keep his place in the side.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Few cricketing talents would be as gifted as the stylish left-handed opener Alastair Cook. Ushered into club and country cricket at 14 and 15 years old respectively, he took to batting as though the willow belonged to him all along. Wristy elegance and authoritative stand-and-deliver stroke-play allowed consistent displays for his club and county Essex, quickly establishing him as a hot prospect knocking hard on England doors.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nWhen Marcus Trescothick suffered an unexpected mental breakdown while preparing in India, 21-year old Cook was summoned from his Academy tour to the West Indies and instilled straight into Trescothick's opening spot for the Nagpur Test. A 60 on debut followed with a century in the second innings, and fan-favourite Trescothick's departure was already forgotten. He retained his position for the home visit to Sri Lanka and Pakistan combining promising starts with half-centuries and centuries. Recurrence of Trescothick's illness later in 2006 saw Cook being selected for the Ashes in Australia. A hundred in Perth was Cook's highlight in a largely disappointing tour. Following Trescothick's shock retirement, young Cook stepped up to fill the void. Confident displays at home against West Indies and on trips to Sri Lanka and England fended early doubts. Runs kept piling and Cook successfully earned his place (and a nickname - Chef) in the England side.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nCook was largely considered to be a Test-specialist and hence wicket-keeper Matt Prior was often preferred over him to open in ODIs. Still, along with the then captain and opening partner Andrew Strauss, the duo became Test cricket's best and longest-running opening pair since 2006. First tentatively named Strauss' deputy in 2008, 'Cooky' eventually went on to lead the Three Lions, where he emerged as a successful skipper. He then took over Strauss as the ODI captain, post-England's quarter-final exit from the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup, as Strauss stepped down.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nTest captaincy followed a year later, after Strauss resigned as skipper, along with announcing his retirement from all forms of the game. Cook made the most of it when England toured India where he led from the front and took his team to a 2-1 series win after 27 years in India. He was also the leading run-scorer of that series. Ashes glory as captain arrived when England hammered the Aussies 3-0 at home to retain the urn. However, the return Ashes probably led to the lowest point of Cook's career as his team couldn't salvage even a draw, losing all the five Tests, thus gifting the urn back to Australia.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nEngland, however, regained the urn in 2015 with Cook at the helm and they also registered a series win in South Africa. The good times though didn't last as they failed to win series against Pakistan back home, followed by another drawn series in Bangladesh. Life came full circle for Alastair Cook as a humiliating 4-0 series loss in India put an end to his captaincy stint. He ended as the joint second-most successful captain for England (24 wins each along with Strauss), behind Michael Vaughan (26)  but also has the most losses to his name.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nWith the extra burden of captaincy gone off his shoulders, Cook continues to flourish as a batsman. He already is England's highest run-scorer in Test cricket and has most of the batting records to his name.</p>",

        "description": "<p>If a legend like Dennis Lillee hails someone as 'once in a generation bowler' then there has to be something really special about that player. Mitchell Johnson's talent was identified at the age of 17 by the Australian legend and he straightaway arranged for him to join the Australian Cricket Academy. Johnson consequently toured England with Australia's Under-19 squad. However, he struggled with back injuries and only made his first-class debut for Queensland at the age of 20. Recurrent breakdowns denied him the early momentum in his career and it was only in 2004-05, when he enjoyed his first injury-free season.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter taking 5-43 for Queensland in a Pura Cup match, he was called up to the ODI squad in 2005 in place of an injured Brett Lee. He showed glimpses of his prodigious talent in an ODI against India in Malaysia, where he ripped through India's top-order, scalping 4-11 in a four-over burst which included the prized wicket of Sachin Tendulkar. Johnson eventually made his Test debut against Sri Lanka in 2007, where he collected impressive match figures of 4/96, after being Australia's 12th man during the entire duration of the 2006-07 Ashes. He went on to have a brilliant ODI series against India, away from home.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt was in the 2008/09 season that he first showed signs of the damage he could inflict with his pace and bounce as he rattled South Africa with figures of 8/61 in the first innings in Perth and then starred in Australia's away tour to South Africa in 2009. It was on this tour that he added a lethal weapon to his armoury, an inswinger, which destroyed the South African batting line-up. He shone not only with the ball but with the bat too as he took the South African attack apart to score his maiden Test century at Cape Town. However, inconsistencies started to surface and he had a rough time after being hammered at Lord's in the second Ashes Test in 2009. He was dropped for the next match but he hit back hard at Headingley, Leeds in the fourth Test with a five-for helping Australia win the Test. He was named the ICC Cricketer of the year award later that year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt was in the 2010-11 Ashes where he was subjected to abusive chants from the Barmy Army due to his inconsistencies. Consistent performances in ODIs meant that he was the spearhead of the Australian bowling attack but his Test place fluctuated. In 2012, he was bought by Mumbai for the fifth edition of the Indian T20 League. Unfortunately, Johnson was ruled out that season as he failed to recover from his toe injury. He wasn't picked in the 2013 Ashes in England where a hapless Australia were beaten 3-0. With the determination to get his Test spot back and sealed, Johnson worked on the technical aspects with Dennis Lillee and the hard work immediately paid rich dividends as he played a major role in helping Mumbai win the 2013 edition of the Indian T20 League.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe renewed vigor helped him gain a spot in the return Ashes later that year where he vindicated the selectors' faith with a splendid all-round performance, helping Australia retain the Ashes. His hostile spell of 7/40 at Adelaide brought back memories of his 8/61 that had terrorized South Africa five years ago. A very good outing in South Africa was paired with a Mohali-purchase in the Indian T20 League for the 2014 season after his previous franchise, Mumbai chose not to retain him.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith a slinging action, Johnson consistently touches the 150 kph mark but is prone to be wayward at times in his zeal for pace. His ability to swing the ball both ways makes him a dangerous prospect with the new ball but it's his brutal short deliveries that set him apart from the other pace bowlers. His big hitting abilities at the death along with his agility in the outfield make him one of the most prized possessions for a skipper.</p>",

Touted as England's most exciting spinner since Phil Tufnell, Monty has a short and simple run up coupled with a quick action and a dangerous arm ball.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProgressing through the ranks of Northamptonshire's youth teams, Monty had a blistering start to his first-class career finishing with match figures of 8/131 against Leicestershire on debut in 2001. But with few opportunities up for grabs, he had to wait for four more years before a prolific domestic season in 2005, during which he picked up 46 Championship wickets at 21.54, boosted his chances of national selection. He was subsequently selected for England's tour of India in 2006 where he had a decent outing and impressed one and all with his guile and pace variations. A decent outing against Sri Lanka at home was followed by a series-winning contribution of 17 wickets against Pakistan which included a brilliant spell of 8/93 at Old Trafford.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConsistent performances meant that he sealed his place as a first choice spinner in the English side. Monty was one of the few shining stars to emerge out of the 5-0 humbling of England at the hands of Australia in the 2006/07 Ashes where he became the first English spinner to scalp a five-for at the WACA. The good form continued as he ended up the home series against West Indies with 23 wicket from four Tests.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, inconsistencies started to surface from then on and Swann's rise to fame against India in the 2008-09 season meant that Monty went out of favour to Swann and soon lost his central contract.

He was picked up as the second spinner for the UAE tour against Pakistan and a resurgent Monty silenced his critics with 14 wickets from just two matches in the series but his efforts went in vain as England were whitewashed 3-0.

        "description": "<p>Munaf Patel's tale is similar to a breed of Indian bowlers such as Sreesanth, Balaji and RP Singh who also broke through the Indian ranks with the same amount of experience backing them as this lad did. Blessed with raw pace, injuries forced him to reorder his motives to become a more all-round bowler with variations.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nYet, it was that pace which saw Patel lauded much before his international debut. When it did arrive, against England in 2006 in a Test at Mohali, it created history. He added supplementary feathers in his cap following a successful Caribbean tour the same year, by which time Patel started to make inroads into a permanent slot. Best ODI figures against Sri Lanka in 2007 further added up to a place in India's bowling attack for the 2007 World Cup. Despite the team's failure in the tournament, Patel kept his place in the ODI team until 2008 after which injuries started to hamper the fast bowler. He played for Rajasthan in the first three seasons of the Indian T20 League before moving to the Mumbai franchise.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nPatel continued to remain in and around the fringes in a pace attack where change is the only constant. He was an active member of the World Cup winning Indian side in 2011 and made a notable contribution to the team’s epic victory by taking wickets on regular occasions. The last of him in India colours was later the same year, against Windies in whites and against England in ODIs and T20Is.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nMunaf was either injured post that or there came up a new generation of pacers that replaced him. He found it impossible to make a comeback post that though he continued playing domestic cricket with the Baroda team till November 2016 when he played his last Ranji match against Tamil Nadu. His last piece of competitive cricket would be when he featured in the Gujarat franchise in the Indian Premier League in 2017. He could not do much there and just faded away slowly into the horizon of his cricketing career.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nMunaf Patel announced his retirement from all forms of competitive cricket in November 2018. He could be proud of the fact that from the batch of pacers he played with, he was one of the latest to leave if not the latest. Zaheer, Nehra, Praveen all have retired before him and he even said that he did not feel sad as he retired because according to him, time was surely up and everyone has to go away from the game one day. In the end, one can just say that it was a career that won a World Cup but had promised so much and surely could have delivered more had fitness been taken care of.</p>",

A part of the Central Districts and New Zealand's Under-19 sides, Taylor made the transition to the senior Districts team in 2003. His inclusion in the ODI side then came on the back of a successful 2005-06 domestic season where he slammed three centuries. Taylor faced West Indies as he made his mark in international cricket in 2006.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRosco, as he is fondly known, went on to score his maiden century against the Lankans in only his third ODI and followed it up with a hundred against Australia. Late in 2007, he made his Test debut against South Africa but tasted enjoyable success at home against England, averaging over 50. An unbeaten 154 in Manchester was the highlight on the following away tour. Consequently, Rosco was gobbled up by Bangalore in the Indian T20 League, Taylor showed his true colours when his stunning 81 off 33 balls took his side to an improbable win against Kolkata in the second season. He was then bought by Rajasthan in the fourth edition, following which, Delhi signed him in 2012. A year later, Delhi traded him with Pune for Ashish Nehra. With Pune was banned for the 2014 season, Rosco rejoined the Delhi squad for 2 crores.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn attacking batsman who is particularly strong on the leg side, Taylor has the special ability to mix offence with defense. A good puller of the ball, his slog sweep also fetches him runs aplenty against spinners. He has also led the Kiwis in ODIs in the absence of their senior skipper, Daniel Vettori. Taylor was then handed full-time captaincy in all three formats after the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup. In spite of some inspiring Test victories under his captaincy, Brendon McCullum was yet again reinstated as captain owing to Taylor's significant problems with the team management. After a brief hiatus from the game during which he missed out on the disastrous South African tour, Taylor came back into the side for the home series against England. He went on to have a successful series at home against West Indies in 2013, where he scored his career best 217 not out and continues to be New Zealand's mainstay in the middle order.</p>",

He did continue to do well in pitches at home, evidenced during South Africa's return tour to Pakistan the same year.

He joined Somerset later that year where his most remarkable performance came against Worcestershire where he scalped 9/65 in an innings. He is part of the Sialkot Stallions squad for the 2012 Champions League T20. But he was banned by the ECB for 12 weeks after testing positive for the recreational drug cannabis.

He retained his place for the 2009 Ashes series, and a 4-58 in his Ashes debut helped England level the series. Later that year, courageous, last-wicket heroics with the bat to deny South Africa victories in two away Tests peeled a new layer of fame.<br />\r\n </p>",

Ravindra Jadeja is a victim of such a stereotype. It was only until a few years later that the talent was truly realized by the Indian selectors and subsequently capitalized to its fullest.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nGlimpses of Jadeja's prodigious talent were evident in his debut First-Class game where he scored 53 for West Zone. He was consequently a member of the 2006 Under-19 World Cup side which reached the final. He made it to the 2008 edition as well where his bowling performance of 2-25 against South Africa in the final played a major role in India's acquisition of the title. A good stint in the Indian T20 league with Rajasthan under the captaincy of Shane Warne who nicknamed him 'Rockstar' and an impressive all-round show in the 2008-09 season prompted selectors to hand him an ODI debut against Sri Lanka. Though India lost, the left-hander impressed with an unbeaten 60.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n2012 turned out to be a productive year for Jadeja. He was one of the marquee signings for the then defending champions Chennai for a whopping 9.72 INR, the most expensive player in that season. Jadeja hit the headlines and record books when he became the first Indian to score three triple centuries in First Class cricket. With an all-rounder's role beckoning and the series already lost to England with one game to play, Jadeja received his first Test cap in 2012 and hasn't looked back since.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe year 2013, saw Jadeja reach greater heights as he ran through the Australian batting line-up with consummate ease in India's 4-0 clean sweep in Tests. He surged to the top in the ICC bowler's rankings in ODIs as well, going past the likes of world class spinners like Saeed Ajmal and Sunil Narine. Constant hard work and self-belief has blessed Jadeja or 'Sir' as he is commonly known today, a regular berth in the Indian team across all the formats.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nDuring India’s home season, he bagged the Player of the series award against Australia in 2017 to further showcase his skills as a Test bowler on surfaces which were relatively better for the batsmen.

He is the first player in ODI history to have scored three double hundreds, including a world record individual score of 264 against Sri Lanka in 2014, and that tells you what a talent he is.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAfter evolving as another batsman from the 'maidans' of Mumbai, Rohit had early ODI success when he toured Australia in 2008. In the first final of the Commonwealth Bank Series, he proved to be a perfect foil for the great Sachin Tendulkar as India claimed the match and eventually the best-of-three contest with another win in the next game. Rohit had earlier scored an important fifty in India’s win against South Africa in the 2007 World T20. The team under MS Dhoni had gone on to lift the trophy in the inaugural tournament.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nDespite success in limited-overs cricket, Rohit failed to get into the Test team, largely because of huge competition for places. He was even unlucky at one point in time when he injured himself in a practice session of the morning of the Test that he was supposed to make a debut in 2009. As fate would have it, Wriddhiman Saha took his place and Rohit had to wait a long time till he eventually broke through against the West Indies in 2013 in what was Tendulkar’s last international series. Rohit ended up having a whale of a time while batting with hundreds in the first two innings he played as India registered innings victories in two Tests.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe move to open with him in the shorter formats of the game worked wonders for him as well as India. After his impressive performance in the ICC Champions Trophy 2013, runs from his bat continued to flow. In the same year, in a high-scoring ODI series against Australia, Rohit amassed 491 runs in just 6 matches which included his first double-hundred. His innings of 209 came off 158 balls and had a total of 16 sixes.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nRohit was ruled out of cricket due to a finger injury but came back all guns blazing, hitting his second ODI double-hundred, against Sri Lanka on November 13, 2014, in Kolkata. Rohit's 264 runs came in just 173 balls which till date is the highest individual score in ODI history. In the following year, Sharma was the second-highest run-scorer for India in the ODI World Cup. Just when it looked he would cement his place in the Test side after a good short run, another finger injury sidelined him during the New Zealand series at home. Sharma missed most of India's successful home season in 2016.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn yet another comeback to cricket, Rohit led the Mumbai franchise to their third Indian T20 league title in 6 years. In the last month of 2017, Rohit scored his third double century in ODIs, once again against Sri Lanka, and was also the captain of the team at that time. It was a memorable knock for him as it came on his wedding anniversary, a gift that his wife cherished by being the live audience. In the same month, against the same opposition but this time in the Twenty20 format of the game, on December 22, Rohit equalled the world record of scoring the joint-fastest century of 35 balls in T20I.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn 2018, Rohit became the second Indian to score 2000 T20I runs and also became the first player to hit 4 T20I centuries. 2018 turned out to be a fruitful year for him in the Blue jersey of India where he even successfully captained the country in the Asia Cup and the Nidahas Trophy.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nRohit Sharma further proved his credentials as a captain when he led Mumbai to their record fourth trophy in the 2019 season. With the bat, Rohit was unstoppable and emerged as the leading run-scorer of the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup. He piled on 648 runs in 9 innings and also hammered 5 centuries, a feat never achieved before. Post a dream World Cup, Rohit was selected in the Test squad for the West Indian tour, a format he's yet to boss. </p>",

But, limited opportunities at the international level propelled him back to domestic cricket and the southpaw turned his attention towards Twenty20 cricket. In 2012, he was signed by the Perth Scorchers ahead of the Champions LeagueT20.</p>",

He has been a consistent and successful player for the Cape Cobras, his best season being 2006-07, where his batting average rose to 72 and with the ball, he touched 30. That instantly earned him a place in South Africa's national team and he was included in the ODI side to face Ireland in 2007. There, an impressive show in the form of a four-wicket haul gained him a berth in the T20 World Championships.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith an uncanny knack of landing the ball in the right place more than most, Philander is one of those bowlers who can bore a batsman out, bowling with consistency day in day out. Extreme pace may not be his ally but this Bellville-born South African has the ability to move the ball at a decent pace both ways and a Test call wasn't far away if you had such attributes with you. Debuting with the red ball against Australia in 2011, Philander made an instant impression with his accuracy. Bagging eight wickets in the game, he helped South Africa to a comfortable victory that won him the Man of the Match award. That performance laid the foundation for more to follow and in the following six Tests, Philander fired past the 50-wicket mark making him the second-fastest in the history of the game. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEar-marked to be one of South Africa's future stars, Philander has altogether added a different dimension to an already dangerous South African attack comprising of Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel. As far as the wickets-tally is concerned, Philander has just started and one thing is for sure, his appetite will just continue to grow.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Daring, tough and fiercely talented, Virat Kohli is arguably one of the finest batsmen that the country has produced. He has even drawn comparisons with the great Sachin Tendulkar. With a firm bottom-hand grip and the ability to smash balls landing on a particular area to any part of the ground at will and without much risk, Kohli has carved a niche of his own in Indian cricket. The king of chases as many of his fans have christened him, Kohli is a deeply hammered nail across all formats.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nKohli rose to fame when he captained India's victorious World Cup Under-19 side in Malaysia, in 2008. He was immediately propelled into the lucrative Twenty20 tournament - the Indian T20 League in 2008 and has since been a part of the Bangalore franchise. He also went on to become the captain of the team in 2012 and has continued to remain so since then. Devoid of noteworthy performances in the first edition, his domestic form still won him an India ODI cap on the tour to Sri Lanka in the same year.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe Delhi lad was initially deployed at various positions in the batting line-up, from replacing Virender Sehwag as an opener to accelerating in the middle-order. After just 25 ODI innings, he had already amassed 9 fifty-plus scores including two centuries. Kohli has always believed in backing his confidence and with the assurance evident in his shot selection and footwork, he was rarely found wanting with his technique even on bowling-friendly surfaces abroad. Once Kohli grew in maturity, especially in the ODIs, lean patches made way for eye-ball grabbing consistency.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe aggressive right-hander had a marvellous run in 2010 during which he amassed close to 1000 runs. He did not let his guard down in 2011 by scoring a century in his maiden World Cup match against Bangladesh and contributed decently right throughout the tournament. The wait for a Test cap ended when he was selected for the tour of West Indies in 2011. The strongest evidence of his mettle came early in 2012 during his maiden ton in whites on India's tour to Australia; he put in an intrepid batting display while the others failed. His efforts paid off and Kohli was soon handed over the vice-captaincy of the Indian team ahead of the Asia Cup in 2012. He ended the tournament as the highest run-getter which included a whirlwind 183 off 148 balls against Pakistan.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nKohli captained the Indian ODI team for the first time against Sri Lanka in a Triangular ODI series in the Caribbean after an injury ruled MS Dhoni out for three ODIs. He then tasted the success of full-fledged captaincy in Zimbabwe where he marshalled the team in absence of Dhoni, who was rested, and achieved a 5-0 clean sweep over the hosts. He added another feather to his cap when he registered the fastest ODI century by an Indian, off just 52 balls, against Australia in October 2013, Jaipur, helping India chase down a daunting target of 360.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn the following year, Kohli single-handedly took India to the finals of the ICC WT20 in Bangladesh but they lost against Sri Lanka at the last hurdle. The next few months would prove to be a massive learning curve for Kohli who was found wanting in the swinging conditions of England. James Anderson was his tormentor as he exposed a distinct weakness outside Kohli’s off stump. He was embarrassed but continued to remain a part of the Test side. In the five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka in November 2014, Kohli led India to a 5-0 routing of the Lankans, making him the first Indian captain to have affected a 5-0 whitewash home and away in ODI cricket.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>In December 2014, Kohli was made the captain of the Test side for India’s first Test against Australia in Adelaide but lost despite scoring centuries in both innings. On 30th December 2014, having saved the third Test for India against Australia at the MCG, Indian captain MS Dhoni announced his retirement from Tests with immediate effect citing too much strain as the reason, handing over the mantle to Virat Kohli for the fourth and final Test match. Kohli ended his disappointment of the England tour by scoring fantastically in the Australian tour, thereby squashing doubts of his class and technique to last in the longest version.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe year 2016 turned out to be Kohli’s best phase by some distance as he plundered runs across formats with his consistency reaching insane levels. He amassed over 2500 international runs at a mind-boggling average of 86.50 with seven centuries and 13 half-centuries from 40 innings. This included a ‘Man of the Tournament’ award in the 2016 World T20 where India made the semifinals. In addition to this, he also racked up a phenomenal 900 runs in the Indian T20 League with an incredible four centuries to his name. During the 2016-17 season, Kohli also became the first batsman to register a double century in four successive Test series, going past the legendary Sir Donald Bradman and Rahul Dravid, both of whom had managed it for three consecutive series. His exploits showed the world that he can dominate in all formats simultaneously without breaking a sweat.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAfter a dreamy 2016-17 season, Virat carried his form to the tour of South Africa in the early part of 2018. Though India lost the series 2-1, his 153 in the second Test at Centurion proved his potential once again in alien conditions. He even took his side to series wins in the limited-overs format, which was a first for India in South Africa. The lad from Delhi went on to become the fastest to reach 10,000 runs in ODI cricket when he reached it in his 205th innings, beating the record holder and compatriot, Sachin Tendulkar who did it in 259 innings. It has not been all personal feats though, the national team has come leaps and bounds under his captaincy. They created history in early 2019 by becoming the first-ever Indian side to register a Test series win over Australia in Australia.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nVirat rather had a modest 2019 World Cup outing as a batsman, he scored 5 consecutive half-centuries but it came as a big surprise that a batsman of his stature didn't convert any into a hundred. Though India led under his leadership finished at the top of the points-table in the group stages of the tournament, India's campaign ultimately ended after a close defeat against New Zealand in the semi-finals.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nDrawing comparisons to greats have never made Virat Kohli lose his work ethic. Having in mind his excellent fitness and ability to adapt to all formats without any fuss, it will not come as a surprise if he ends up owning most batting records by the time he brings the curtains down on his career.</p>",

He carried the good form into the next season as well.

An injury to Michael Clarke paved the way for another comeback, this time in a tri-series in Zimbabwe including South Africa.

He made his first-class debut against Auckland in 2007 before captaining New Zealand in their 2008 Under-19 WC campaign. A decent 2008-09 season was followed by a fantastic 2009-10 one where he excelled particularly in the shorter format scoring 621 runs at an average of 77.62. This earned him a contract with the national side and he made his ODI debut in 2010 against India scoring ducks in his first two games. But in his fifth game, despite being injured and aided by a runner, Williamson showed great determination to score his maiden century which very nearly won the game for the Kiwis against Bangladesh. Later that year, he went on to score his maiden Test century in his very first game against India in Ahmedabad.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nA quiet 2011 was followed up with a noisy 2012 when a gritty, unbeaten Test ton against the world's most dangerous fast bowling attack of Dale Steyn and co. saved New Zealand from a humiliating defeat. Williamson became New Zealand's youngest ODI captain as well as the fourth youngest in history when in 2012, he was appointed stand-in skipper in place of injured Ross Taylor for the series against West Indies. Given the quality he possesses, Williamson is arguably the best batsman that the New Zealand team has garnered from the current generation.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nWilliamson continued to perform well in international games and was appointed the deputy to Brendon McCullum for the 2015 World Cup. The Kiwi batsman had a quiet World Cup according to his standards but his knock against Australia when he took the Kiwi's home after surviving a devastating spell of fast bowling from Mitchell Starc proved his credentials. After the retirement of Brendon McCullum in 2016, Williamson was appointed the captain of New Zealand for all formats.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nWilliamson made his Indian T20 league debut in 2015 for the Hyderabad team as a back-up for David Warner and hence, did not get many opportunities in the initial seasons. In the 2018 edition, Kane was appointed the captain of Hyderabad in the absence of David Warner. He had a prolific tournament as he ended up as the highest run-scorer (735 runs) and also led his team to the final where they lost to Chennai.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe classic batting of Kane Williamson often overshadows his captaincy skills which were once again on display in the 2019 Cricket World Cup. Riding on his great leadership and batting form, the Kiwis entered the final and gave England a good run for their money, missing the trophy by a whisker. Kane had an outstanding World Cup on a whole and was adjudged the Player of the Tournament. </p>",

        "description": "<p>With the ability to swing the ball both ways, left-armer Trent Boult possesses phenomenal ability when running in through the 30 yards. Seaming conditions obviously aided his style of bowling but the fact that he can make the ball talk on tracks which virtually had nothing in them, makes him a significant threat to batsmen all around the world.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nBorn in Rotorua, Boult jumped onto the international stage when he was invited to the New Zealand A team for the 2007 winter training squad in Lincoln. He was a typical Kiwi lad, enjoying the water sports in his country like most people did. Cricket, though, was where his wandering heart eventually landed upon. At just 17 years of age, he became the fastest bowler in the secondary school in the country, showing his glaringly evident skills. In 2008, one year later, he was selected for the New Zealand U-19 team that would go on to play the World Cup. He was always hanging around the edges, waiting for the chance to come knocking on his door. It was a long wait but his debut came in 2011 against Australia in Hobart. He picked up 4 wickets in that game, helping his side win a Test Down Under for the first time since 1985.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nBoult’s career didn’t exactly take off as he’d have liked to. A couple of years before making his Test debut, he suffered a major stress fracture on his back, which was largely down to his tinkered bowling action. So, he took help from one of his idols and ex-Kiwi great Shane Bond. He went back to his old bowling action which yielded him much success in his younger days and that bettered him. He took his time to improve himself physically, conditioned his body well and got ready for the big stage. Had a decent start to his would-be-illustrious career in whites, scalping 17 wickets in his first 6 games, against teams like Australia, South Africa, West Indies, Zimbabwe and India. He put in consistent performances throughout but his moment to shine came in 2013 against the Windies at the Basin Reserve where he got his maiden ten-wicket haul in Tests.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nTrent’s been highly rated by former New Zealand great Sir Richard Hadlee, who thinks he’s one of the best new ball bowlers the Kiwis have ever had. He formed one half of the deadly duo with good friend Tim Southee, a pair which was the focal point of many wins they achieved. In 2014, which was Black Caps’ best Test year, the pair collected 67 out of 143 wickets in that year - almost half of the total. However, this came about because of a transformation inspired by Brendon McCullum when he took over as skipper. McCullum always had a taste for the attacking flavour and with Boult collecting wickets like a hunter on the top of his game, he couldn’t be ignored for too long, the combination was a perfect match. Due to the Kiwis lack of quality in pace at the time, Trent Boult spearheaded the attack along with Southee and come the 2015 World Cup, he ended up as the joint-highest wicket-taker of the tournament with 22 wickets to his name. He was one of the key figures in New Zealand making it to their first ever World Cup final.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nBoult didn’t feature in the 2016 edition of the World T20, but that had nothing to do with his ability and everything to do with New Zealand’s pragmatic approach to things. He was snapped up by Hyderabad in 2015, before eventually making the switch to Kolkata in 2017, both being big money signings. In the following year, Delhi bagged his services and in spite of his team not faring well, he played a good hand and finished with 18 wickets.</p>",

The following year, he was named captain of the Sri Lankan T20 side, along with the vice-captaincy role in the longer version. Chandimal, however, withdrew his participation in the Indian T20 League's sixth season to concentrate on further training for Sri Lanka's international commitments. Chandimal plays a major role for Sri Lanka in all formats of the game.</p>",

He earned his call-up to the national squad in 2009 as an emergency backup to an injured Angelo Mathews and has since then impressed with both bat and ball.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOpening the bowling for his Under-19 squad, Thisara performed well on the England tour and was brilliant in a tri-nation tournament involving India and Bangladesh, picking up eight wickets in four matches. His performances earned him a ticket to Sri Lanka's Under-19 team for the World Cup held in Malaysia in 2008. Injuries to senior players paved the way for an ODI debut against India in 2009. Thisara also took six wickets in the tri-series involving India and Bangladesh in Dhaka and shared a match-winning partnership with Thilan Samaraweera against India. Since then, Perera has regularly featured in ODIs and T20Is for Sri Lanka and has made a reputation for himself for his ability to strike a heavy ball and clear the boundary with relative ease. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDue to his all-round prowess, Perera was usurped by the Chennai franchise in the Indian T20 League in 2010. He then represented the now defunct Kerala franchise in 2011 before being transferred to Mumbai for the 5th edition of the Indian T20 League in 2012. The following year, he was released from Mumbai and traded to the Hyderabad franchise for the sixth edition of the league. Perera’s pattern of one-year stints in various teams in the league continued when he became the only Sri Lankan player to be bought in the 2014 auction. He was one of the many key buys made by Mohali. In the Big Bash League, Perera was picked by Brisbane Heat.<br />\r\n </p>",

        "description": "<p>There are some players who may not have had excellent careers as such but with a handful of big performances on the big stage earned a name for themselves in the annals of cricketing history. New Zealand’s Grant Elliott was surely one among these. His nerveless unbeaten knock in the semifinal of the 2015 World Cup against South Africa is unforgettable, considering the last-over finish that it was. It ensured that New Zealand reached their first-ever World Cup final and the South African-born Elliott was pivotal to the cause. Although the Kiwis lost in the final against Australia, he again played decently albeit without any support from the rest of the team. Nevertheless, his semifinal heroics had given his adopted country their maiden World Cup runners-up medal.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAlthough Elliott’s innings in the 2015 semifinal was a masterclass, it wasn’t the first time he had done such a feat in a knockout game. In the 2009 Champions Trophy semi-final against Pakistan, he had stroked a measured fifty to see his side through in another tricky run chase to get New Zealand into the final. It’s certain that the man loved pressure moments but what would disappoint cricketing fans is the fact that he underachieved drastically in his career barring the odd flashes of brilliance that came about.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHaving moved to New Zealand in 2001 to pursue his cricketing career, it took several seasons of domestic cricket before he was recognized with an international call-up in 2008. The 2008-09 season saw Grant not only featuring in limited-overs but also in a few Tests as well although it was clear that he was more at ease with white-ball cricket. His LOI career was fairly reasonable during this phase but injuries forced him out of the side and post that, he was mostly in and out of the squad.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAfter featuring briefly in the 2012-13, he was called back a few months before the 2015 World Cup due to his form in the domestic circuit. The management felt that the experience of Elliott would help the side during the showpiece tournament - a fact that he proved during the semifinal. Despite having a good 2015, his form dipped the next year and the age factor saw the Kiwis dropping him from the side. He retired the same year from the format and quit international cricket totally in 2017.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nElliott did have fairly good success with franchise cricket, especially in Pakistan Super League. In 2017, he got named in the World XI that visited Pakistan for a 3-match T20I series that was held in a bid to revive international cricket in the country. On the 21st of August 2018, Grant Elliott decided to call it quits from all cricket. It just so happens that some careers never end up being fulfilled. In the end, Elliot would agree and say that he could have done more after making a bold move to migrate, but overall he would be pleased with the big moments he was able to provide his country with.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The term ‘left-hander’s elegance’ seems very justified and apt when you see Hettige Don Rumesh Lahiru Thirimanne bat. The classic cover drive, where the bat, sort of artistically meets the ball, only to send it crashing to the fence and the body leans into the shot to end up with a nice pose for the cameras to capture, is a shot in his repertoire that is boast-worthy.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThirimanne started off pretty young and his early promise ended up in him being a part of Sri Lanka U-19 World Cup side in 2008. In his first full season for his First-Class side, Ragama Cricket Club, he showed his ability with the bat. He was the leading run-scorer for his side and stood out for his epitome of consistency in the competition with a healthy batting average of close to 60. This stupendous season of his did not go unnoticed and he was handed an opportunity to represent the national, albeit in the ODI tri-series involving India and Bangladesh in Bangladesh.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nA year later, he was handed his Test cap against England after Tillakaratne Dilshan was ruled out of the third game of the series. As early as in his third match, he showed his determined approach in notching up a laboured maiden Test fifty. Although his appearances were rather sporadic, he showed his presence with some knocks here and there but was largely inconsistent.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe moment in his career so far came in the third Test against Australia in 2013. Within 36 hours from landing, he played a defining knock of 91 and helped his side put up a respectable total on board. What that outing did for him is it earned him laurels and also helped the world take notice of him. Soon after that, he brought up his maiden Test ton against Bangladesh, which is his best score yet.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThirimanne’s outing in the Asia Cup 2014 seemed like he had finally come of age. Being the tourney’s top run scorer, he helped Sri Lanka win the title with vital contributions at the top of the order, with a couple of tons under his belt. Numbers show that the southpaw is an effective top order batsman and his average tapers down as he moves down in the batting order. Yet he was regarded to be a finisher when he started playing.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nEarly in 2015, he was the stand-in captain in the last 3 matches of ODI series against New Zealand after the regular skipper was ruled out due to injury. Although results-wise things didn’t really go as per order, Thirimanne picked up a couple of wickets in his first game as captain.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHis batting technique was such that he was long touted to be an ideal replacement for Kumar Sangakkara. However, it didn’t turn out to be that way as inconsistency turned to be his undoing and ended up in him being excluded from the side. After a couple of appearances in 2016, he was recalled to the Test squad first in September 2017 for the series against India. He did not feature then but in the one-dayers, he hit two fifties in three games that he played.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn the ensuing series against Pakistan, Lahiru had a forgettable outing in the longest format before getting among the runs in the limited overs fixtures. Sri Lanka would want the left-handed batsman to use his experience and ability to get among the runs and ensure that his team has a good outing.</p>",

He was later bought by Chennai in 2011. Saha couldn’t get many chances with Dhoni taking the gloves and other prominent batsmen edging him easily into the playing XI. However, the 2014 season provides him with a new dawn as he was picked by Mohali in the auction, with no other specialist keeper in the squad.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA few fine performances for India A later helped Saha earn his maiden Test call-up in early 2010 as the team’s reserve wicket keeper with his chances of debuting next to impossible. However India’s bizarre decision to go into the series with just seven specialist batsmen backfired as Laxman and Rohit Sharma injured themselves before the game and with little time left, Saha was quickly drafted in as a specialist batsman. The nerves showed as he got out on a duck in the first innings but was more watchful in his second scoring 36. Dropped thereafter, he returned to the ODI version in late 2010, debuting against New Zealand after MS Dhoni was rested for the series. In 2011, he earned a surprise call-up to India’s ODI squad for the series in the West Indies, in the absence of most of the senior players.</p>",

He dominated the T20s not only in the domestic leagues but also at the international level. He holds the record for being the first person to take 6 wickets in an innings in a T20I and if that was something, he bettered that performance by another 6-wicket haul, making him the only man to do so twice.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nMendis' stock delivery is the off-spin but he can bowl top spinners, flippers, googlies and just about anything at different pace and action including the carrom ball which he releases with his middle finger. His greatest attribute though is his accuracy and the absolute control with which he bowls these deliveries.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nWith time and modern video analysis, the mystery about him faded and with opposition batsmen picking him, he started to struggle a bit. Last played an international match in 2015, his career was soon hampered by numerous injuries which sidelined Mendis from joining the national squad. Some poor performances with the ball along with injuries resulted in him getting completely out of the radar of the selectors. On 28th August 2019, the Sri Lankan mystery spinner bid adieu to the cricketing world and retired from all forms of cricket.</p>",

Post debut, he went through a quiet phase in his career, as nothing substantial happened. However, it was in the 2008-09 season that he truly emerged as a fast bowling all-rounder and displayed his potential. His useful bowling helped Tamil Nadu reach the semi-finals of the Ranji Trophy. Ganapathy was equally adept with the bat. He scored 543 runs at a staggering 77.57 and took 18 wickets at the end of the following season. His brilliant domestic performances led to an IPL contract with the Chennai Super Kings in the 2010 edition, though he played just a single game.

While Ashwin didn’t get instant success, over a period of time he developed into a top-class off spinner. He followed the path of Kumble in giving up a flourishing engineering career to pursue cricket.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAshwin enjoyed a brilliant 2006-07 debut domestic season with Tamil Nadu. However, the off-spinner showed his mettle during his comeback in 2008, first with Chennai in the Indian T20 league and then with stellar performances for Tamil Nadu with both bat and ball.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAfter having made it to the ODI team in early 2010, Ashwin wasn't a part of the playing eleven initially. But with his exploits in the Indian T20 league, he was awarded another chance and he responded with a quickfire 38 on debut against Sri Lanka. He was given a surprise entry into the 15-member Indian team for the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup as a supporting spinner to the then spearhead, Harbhajan Singh.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>Ashwin enjoyed a dream Test debut, picking up nine wickets against West Indies, the second best match figures for an Indian bowler on debut, behind Narendra Hirwani's 16. The development and use of the carrom ball by Ashwin gave him a sharper edge. An opening batsman by aspiration, Ashwin couldn't realise that goal but turned into an important all-rounder for India, especially in Tests with two centuries against West Indies.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nEarly in 2017, Ashwin surpassed the Aussie legend Dennis Lillee by becoming the fastest player to reach 250 wickets (in 45 Tests). With 82 wickets in the 2016-17 season, he went past Dale Steyn’s record for the most scalps in a single season.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nBesides being a great bowler, Ashwin is very effective as a batsman and finished 2016 as the No.1 Test all-rounder in the ICC rankings before being toppled by Shakib Al Hasan in March 2017. Often with centuries and half-centuries, especially in Tests, he has spoiled many an opposition team’s party. India’s spin future is in great hands with Ashwin around!</p>",

He was a teenage prodigy and destined for success due to his extraordinary skill-set. Moeen was signed by Warwickshire as a 15-year-old and he didn't waste time in impressing one and all.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAli also captained England in the 2006 Under-19 World Cup and took his team till the semi-final. Due to limited opportunities at Warwickshire, Moeen switched to the rival county team, Worcestershire. He played a vital role in his side winning the Pro-40 title in 2007 and one of his knocks, a blazing 46-ball century, was much-talked about. After working hard in the domestic circuit and showing his all-round abilities, the national selectors finally picked him for the ODI series against West Indies and the World T20 that followed.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIt didn't take long for Moeen to break into the English Test team and that was also helped by the untimely retirement of Graeme Swann. His elegance with the bat and ability to bowl useful off-breaks played a big role in his selection. Ali made his Test debut against Sri Lanka at Lord's and in his very second Test, he almost saved the match for his team with a valiant century.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nConsidered as a part-time spinner, Moeen's career graph in Tests jumped to another level when he picked 19 wickets against the touring Indian team and surprised many. Always open to learning, it was later known that Ali benefited from the technical advice from Kumar Dharmasena, who was an umpire in the series. Post that, his Test career went from strength to strength and he established himself as a key member of the England unit. His career in the limited-overs cricket also went well side by side where he usually batted in the top order. However, things changed after the 2015 World Cup debacle and the selectors left him out of the ODI team so he could work on his red ball bowling.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe emergence of Alex Hales and Jason Roy at the top of the order increasingly made it tough for Moeen to get his place back but he never lost hope. Soon, he was picked by the selectors with a new role to bat in the lower order and his useful bowling worked as a plus point. In the year 2017, against the visiting South African team, Moeen Ali created a record by becoming the first player in Test history to take 25 wickets and score 250-plus runs in a 4-match Test series.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nA player for all formats, Moeen has become a vital cog in England's game plan and his disciplined approach has given him and his team immense success.</p>",

He made 30 and 34 in the two innings he got but wasn't selected in the second Test with England going for the 5th bowling option. He suffered a huge setback when a blood clot in his lung ruled him out of the England Performance Programme trip to Australia in November 2010. But he made a miraculous comeback and hit a career best 300 not out against Yorkshire. In 2012, he played an important role in helping Hampshire win their second T20 title in three years, beating Yorkshire by 10 runs in the final. Later that year, he was added to the T20 squad for Hampshire's first Champions League T20 outing, in South Africa.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJust when one would have felt that Carberry went out of reckoning for the national team, he was recalled for the ODI series against Australia in 2013 but the major reprieve came when he was chosen for the Ashes later that year and featured in the playing XI right away at the 'Gabba for the first Test until the final one in Sydney.

He had a good 2009 season where he produced a brilliant spell of 4/29 to power Hampshire to a three-wicket win over Gloucestershire in a Pro40 match at the Rose Bowl. He continued the good work in the 2010 season too but unfortunately he got injured again and missed most part of the season. However, he was back in 2012 and was a part of the T20 side that beat Yorkshire to win that year’s domestic T20 title. He was eventually named in Hampshire’s Champions League T20 squad.</p>",

His impressive figures of 8-140 against Western Australia in 2006-07 made him South Australia's leading wicket-taker that season. He went on to represent Queensland, before signing up with Sussex in county cricket, only to realize that he had breached the county's contract by signing as a local for the former. He then signed up to play for Yorkshire in 2010. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n'Ryano' made his international debut in a one-day match against South Africa in 2009. He did not have a memorable debut though. His moment came exactly a year later. Acting as a replacement in the side, he bowled brilliantly against Pakistan, scalping 13 wickets in 3 ODIs, which eventually led to his Test debut against New Zealand. His bowling figures in windy conditions were proof enough of his strike-power. Harris also played in the Indian Premier League in 2009, where he represented the eventual winners, Hyderabad. He was later bought by Mohali in 2011 and was part of Brisbane Heat in the Big Bash League. Harris made his T20I debut against the West Indies in 2010 and was also part of the 2010 World Twenty20 side, replacing the speedster, Brett Lee. However, injuries to the knee restricted his chances of a permanent spot in the national team, and he was consequently dropped in favour of other fit bowlers. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nLike Shane Watson, Harris had to eat his own pie of injuries over his career. However, the selectors kept faith in him and provided him with further opportunities whenever he returned to full fitness, and boy, didn't he repay them with every dime! Harris proved to be one of the best bowlers for Australia during their Ashes loss in England, in 2013 and his body, surprisingly stood by him during the return Ashes later in the same year. For the first time in his career, he played a continuous string of 5 Test matches and bowled exceedingly well in each!</p>",

He will be representing the Hyderabad franchise in the 2014 Indian T20 League. This will be his fifth different Indian T20 League franchise that he will be representing.</p>",

The right-arm medium pacer was playing just his 11th first-class game, then. His career graph took a snake-head climb from there on, turning into a consistent wicket-taker in ODIs.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>He didn’t get many opportunities in Tests but showed his true skills when he picked up his first five-for in the Nottingham Test in 2014. Another five-for followed in the next Test which India won at Lord’s which also put his name on the Lord’s Honors Board. He ended up taking 19 wickets in five matches besides scoring 247 runs with the help of three fifties. Things appeared rosy for Bhuvi at that time but soon the pressure of international cricket got to him. He failed to cope up with the extra workload and it started to reflect in his bowling. He struggled and didn’t take wickets as easily as he did before.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>Consequently, Kumar lost his place in the side as he thrived for extra pace and in the process lost his main weapon, i.e. swing. After beginning with Bangalore and a stint with Pune, it was with Hyderabad franchise in 2014 where he started to get his mojo back. There were talks about him being only a new-ball bowler but he toiled hard to better his bowling with the old ball and came out triumph, acquiring the quality to bowl fast yorkers at the death. He also became the first bowler to win the award for most wickets in an edition in successive seasons of the Indian T20 League.</p>",

Then, he held cricket's hand at the age of 19 and things changed forever.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nYadav went to the non-glamourous Vidarbha team to start his journey and started his grind. Gifted with a well-built body, swift, crisp action and natural fast bowling speed, Umesh rose through the ranks. He made his Ranji debut for Vidarbha in 2008, took a 4-fer and finished the season claiming 20 wickets at 14.60.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nJust after two years in the domestic circuit, the Indian selectors took notice of his 140+ speed, a rare thing for an Indian bowler, and selected him in the ODI squad for Zimbabwe's tour in 2010.  He attracted eyeballs with his pace and Delhi got him for the 2010 season of the Indian T20 League. Soon he made his Test debut as well, in 2011, against Windies at home. The MS Dhoni-led team took him along to Australia in the same year. They lost the Test series but Umesh's bowling impressed everyone. He picked 14 wickets in an otherwise hapless series and proved to be a ray of light through the darkness for the depleted Indian pace bowling unit.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nJust when things started to look bright, Yadav got injured in 2012. The selectors gave him time to recover as he was out of the international fold for over a year. Then, he returned and was a part of the ICC Champions Trophy-winning squad in 2013. He was a delight to watch in England as he used the swing and pacy conditions to a great effect but the bouts of inconsistency along with it didn't help his case for a permanent spot in the playing XI.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAfter a couple of years in the capital city, Kolkata swooped him for the 7th edition of the Indian T20 League. He joined the ranks with Pat Cummins, Morne Morkel and Jacques Kallis under the leadership of Gautam Gambhir. In the 2018 auction, the Bangalore-based franchise, hand-picked him and gave him the reigns of their bowling department.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHe is a rhythm bowler, lethal when he finds it and below ordinary when it gets disrupted. Till date, his performance in Australia and New Zealand during the 2015 edition of the World Cup has been his best as he extracted pace and bounce off the Aussie tracks, and though India failed to retain their title, Umesh ended the tour as India's best bowler with 18 wickets. </p>",

This was mainly because NSW had an established keeper in the form of Daniel Smith. As a result, the rookie keeper looked towards Grade cricket and the Futures League to press his case. In the inaugural edition of the Big Bash League, he was a part of the Sydney Sixers, a team that eventually went on to win the T20 tournament.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nNevill was called back to the NSW side, for an FR Cup match against Tasmania. He received flak for his performance behind the stumps but backed that up with a knock of 105 against South Australia, in a Sheffield Shield game. Peter had a productive first-class season in 2011-12 scoring 570 runs at a terrific average of 51.81. As a result, he was a selected as a backup keeper to Matthew Wade for the tour of West Indies but he didn't get a game.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nNevill went back to Sheffield Shield and piled up the runs on a consistent basis. An outstanding 2014-15 season was an example of his caliber and he finished 8th on the list of the highest run-scorer with 764 runs. His career-best score of 235 also came in that season.

Nevill responded with a monster 179 not out for NSW in the Sheffield Shield immediately and backed it up with few more big innings. The wicketkeeper's spot in an Australian XI has always been open for debate since the retirement of Brad Haddin and Peter Nevill will be hopeful of reclaiming the position.</p>",

Although Latham did not taste any major success in that series, he toured the sub-continent with the New Zealand A team playing List A games against India A and Sri Lanka A in the later part of 2013. His stand-out innings of 86 against Sri Lanka in November in the second ODI saw his team chase a huge total in a rain-affected game. That performance also earned him the Man of the Match award and showed the world that he was ready for the hard grind of international cricket.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nLatham made his Test debut against India in 2014 when Ross Taylor made himself unavailable for the series. It was not a great start for him as he got out for a duck in the first innings and scored 29 runs in the second innings. After putting in some consistent performances in the domestic circuit, Tom was called back to the ODI squad. His Test career saw an upward movement in the series against Pakistan as he registered back-to-back centuries.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nSince Brendon McCullum retired in 2016, Latham has cemented his place in the Kiwi squad. He played an important role in the series against India which was played in the sub-continent. Tom scored 3 fifties on that tour which showcased him as a good player of spin. In the year 2018, Latham notched up his maiden Test double ton, against Sri Lanka. The wicket-keeper batsman was an integral member of the Black Caps' unit in the 2019 World Cup and made a handy contribution in the final, although in a losing cause.</p>",

But, his success in the Twenty20 and limited-overs side was relatively limited.

At 17, the speedster was busy opening the bowling for his school team before earning an unexpected call-up from the Central Districts as Michael Mason’s replacement, who in turn had been called up for national duty for the Kiwis.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe Palmerston North-born player impressed on his first-class debut in 2010 against Canterbury, scalping his maiden wicket in only his second ball and finished off the innings with figures of 4-52. His initial performances amazed his club who decided to look beyond his inexperience and included him for the 2010 Champions League T20 held in South Africa. He played two games in the tournament and impressed with his sheer pace. Cricket pundits touted him as the fastest New Zealand bowler after Shane Bond. He clocked speeds in the range of 145-150 kph consistently. His raw talent earned him a place in New Zealand’s squad for the T20I series against Pakistan, where he made his debut. However, he didn't have a good start and after that, injuries disrupted his first-class career.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nMilne once again came into the limelight when he was selected in New Zealand's squad for the 2012 World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka. But, he kept on suffering from injuries and that led the selectors to adopt a cautious approach regarding him. That limited his first-class exposure. He only got a few games on and off for his national side but again grabbed attention during the series against Pakistan in UAE in December 2014, where he troubled the batsmen and hurried them constantly. That caught the fancy of the selectors again as he got named in the squad for the 2015 World Cup. He was the third frontline pacer and fulfilled his duty till the quarter-final. Luck once again did not favour him as his campaign ended due to another injury before the semi-final.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAdam Milne was picked in the Indian T20 League auction by Bangalore in 2015 but missed the tournament due to fitness issues. He was retained by them in the year 2016 but only got one game. Hamstring, side and elbow injuries kept him away from cricket for a year after which he returned to play for his franchise. The 2017 season saw him play four matches but he didn't make any kind of substantial impact. After that, he featured for the Kiwis in the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy and fared decently but there was no noteworthy performance. The good thing is that he is young but to survive in international cricket over a long period, the speedster continuously needs to adapt his game to suit different pitches and conditions. Fitness is also a major issue which he needs to address. </p>",

It was after his switch to Auckland however, that he started making serious impact.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>A string of good performances in List A games propelled him into the New Zealand squad for the T20Is and ODIs on the 2012 tour of South Africa. He made his T20I debut in Durban and had an excellent start to his ODI career with figures of 4/20. He became just the second New Zealand player after Dayle Hadlee to scalp four wickets on ODI debut. With the ability to swing the ball at a good pace and a knack of picking up wickets at regular intervals, McClenaghan has grown leaps and bounds since his inception in the international arena and has been an integral part of the limited overs Kiwi side.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>Injuries did hamper his progress in 2016 but despite his good comeback, the form of Trent Boult and Tim Southee meant he got limited opportunities for his national side.

Over the years, Zulfiqar played for different teams including Pakistan A playing against Sri Lanka as well as the West Indies. Although he could not make an entry into the national side, Zulfiqar boasts of a staggering record in the domestic circuit having picked up 309 wickets in 63 games at an impressive average of 20.36.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt a time when Pakistan had the likes of Mushtaq Ahmed and Saqlain Mushtaq in their spin department, making an entry into the side was a distant dream for Zulfiqar but destiny showered its blessings on him on 27th July, 2013 when he was given a chance to wear the national colors against West Indies in a T20 international match. Zulfiqar, then at 34 and 229 days, became only the second oldest player to play a T20 international for Pakistan. Picking up 5 wickets in the two match series, he was named Man of the Series as he impressed everyone with his spell. Zulfiqar, who says that his father never forced him to take up football, allowed him to play with an open mind.<br />\r\n </p>",

The tall, lanky all-rounder was included in the Sri Lankan T20I squad for the series against Australia in 2011. But he had to wait for his international debut, which came in early 2012 in an ODI against South Africa.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSenanayake boasted of tremendous numbers in domestic cricket at the time of his maiden international outing - 297 first class wickets in just 59 games at a stupendous average of 20.50. However, his international stint was a brief one as he did not perform as expected of him. That forced the selectors to drop him back to the domestic circuit and this was when he found his second coming. Being a spinner in the modern age can be more of a bane than a boon but Senanayake developed one of the most lethal deliveries for an off-spinner, 'the doosra' or the one that goes the other way. A flurry of wickets saw Senanayake re-enter the foray of international cricket when he was snapped up by the Kolkata franchise for the sixth edition  of the Indian T20 League. Known to handle pressure in big tournaments, he has done well in Sri Lanka's main one-day competition. He played for Uva Next in the first edition of the Sri Lanka Premier League and was also named in the Champions League T20 squad. He has also played for Sydney Sixers in the Big Bash League in the 2012 edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother strong performance in the domestic circuit in 2013 saw him earn a re-call for the ODI series against Bangladesh and his performance was good enough to garner a place in the Champions Trophy in England later in the year. One of the striking distinctions that Senanayake possesses, is the ability to bowl six different balls in an over.</p>",

He was picked in the ODI side as a replacement wicket-keeper for AB de Villers against New Zealand.

Late in the year, de Kock started to exhibit his true colours. Notching up his debut hundred in the ODIs against Pakistan, de Kock announced that he was finally ready to take the world by storm and that is what he did when the Indians came calling later in the year. In the three-match ODI series that followed, de Kock finished with a hundred in each of the three games amassing 342 runs, the most by any batsman in a three-match bilateral series. In 2014, de Kock was bought by the Delhi franchise to play for them in the seventh edition of the Indian T20 League. Barely out of his teens, age is definitely on the side of de Kock and if he stays fit and healthy, this kid could well be the next big thing in South Africa as well as international cricket.</p>",

In 2011, he was picked by Kolkata for the fourth season of the Indian T20 League.

He was drafted into the Test squad thereafter, against West Indies and made his debut on his home ground at the Eden Gardens. He shell-shocked the West Indians with his reverse swing, finding the stumps on numerous occasions and attaining the best figures (9/118) by a pacer on Test debut for India.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nSoon, Shami was selected in the ODIs as well and he didn't disappoint.

He missed the limited-overs tour to Australia, Asia Cup and World T20 during that period.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nWhen Shami returned to full fitness, he was drafted into India's Test squad to play in West Indies. With 11 wickets, he was the second most successful bowler for India in the series and showed his class once again. Shami continued his progress and played a key role in India's overseas Test tours in 2017/18. In the shorter versions as well, Mohammad Shami had a strong tour of New Zealand in early 2019 where he was India's leading wicket-taker and also achieved 100 ODI wickets to become the fastest Indian to reach that landmark in terms of matches.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIt was a no-brainer that India picked Shami in their World Cup squad for 2019. After waiting for a few games, he got a chance to play in place of an injured Bhuvneshwar Kumar and took a hat-trick against Afghanistan, thereby becoming only the second Indian to achieve this feat. </p>",

He once made a famous comment to Mike Atherton, saying that he had seen better batsmen in his fridge. He did not stop at that, but dismissed Atherton in both innings of what transpired to be the English skipper’s last championship game, proving just why he should be a force to reckon with.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInjuries soon raised concerns over his bowling and Kirby struggled with his form since 2004, taking just 31 wickets at a not-so-impressive average of 36 and above. He was released by Yorkshire and was immediately signed by Gloucestershire in 2005, before moving to Somerset in 2011 on a three-year contract.</p>",

Despite not having played first-class cricket, he featured in the inaugural Caribbean T20 in 2010, bagging a five-wicket haul against Trinidad and Tobago. Later, in 2011, Santokie was included in the West Indies T20I squad for the series against England. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne look at him and he could easily be passed as just another dibbly-dobbly bowler but he is anything but. A bowler who thrives on change of pace, Santokie has the ability to deceive batsmen with his shard swinging deliveries as well as contrastingly slow cutters that completely take unsuspecting batsmen off guard. Having spent a number of years in England,he mastered the art of swing bowling which he continues to use in international cricket. Santokie was instrumental in taking West Indies to the semis of the ICC WT20 2014 with timely wickets and miserly spells. No wonder, he was grabbed by the Mumbai franchise for the 2014 edition of the Indian T20 League.</p>",

He is a versatile middle-order batsman and is assured both against pace and spin. Debuting for Victoria in 2011-12, he made a good impression with a knock of 71 runs against Queensland at the Gabba. He also scored a brilliant 113 at the Adelaide Oval in the domestic circuit in 2012. At that time, Matthew Wade had got injured and so, Handscomb was given the responsibility to do wicket-keeping for his side. That landed him a contract with the Melbourne Stars in the Big Bash League. The talented young man has played county cricket for Gloucestershire in 2015 as well. In 2016, he got a taste of the Indian T20 league as he was picked up by Pune in the auctions.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHandscomb was selected in the Australian ODI squad that was touring England in 2015 but didn't play a match. Consistently churning up runs for Victoria for a period of time didn't go unnoticed and he was rewarded with a Test call-up in 2016-17. He made his debut against South Africa at Adelaide Oval in the third game of the series. A debut to remember, Handscomb stroked himself to a well-constructed fifty. He also scored the winning run for his country, something that he will always cherish.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAfter that, Pakistan were touring Australia in December 2016 and Handscomb notched up his form one step further. He scored a ton in his second Test match and scored another one later in the series, kicking off 2017 in style. When the Australian summer came to an end, Handscomb achieved a commendable record. In his first seven innings of Test cricket, he never departed below 50 and became the first player in Test history to do so. The team from Down Under then travelled to India in February 2017. An unbeaten 72 from Handscomb in the third Test in Ranchi was a testament to his potential. He combined with Shaun Marsh and kept the Indians at bay for a long time, thereby saving the match for his side. Handscomb proved his skills later in 2017 in Bangladesh as well. He scored a gutsy 82 in Chittagong in tricky conditions. With the kind of batting potential he has displayed in his short career so far, Australia will be hoping to benefit from his presence in the middle order.  </p>",

At 6 feet 4, he is a lanky and accurate bowler and is known to bowl at any stage of the game as and when required.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nBehrendorff started his playing career with Australian Capital Territory. He represented them at U-17 and U-19 level. He first caught the attention of state selectors when he played for the Prime Ministers XI against the New Zealand national team in 2009. As a result, he was recruited to play for the 2009-10 season by Western Australia. He made his List A debut for Western Australia in the 2010-11 season. Due to injuries to the senior members of the squad, he kept on getting opportunities to make a mark for himself. On his Sheffield Shield debut in 2011, Dorff bagged figures of 4/76 playing against Victoria. Behrendorff was offered contracts with both Western Australia and the Perth Scorchers for the 2012–13 season due to his performances in the past year.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nJason's breakout moment came in the 2014-2015 season playing in the Australian Big Bash League. Playing for Perth Scorchers, he was a pivotal part of the squad as they won consecutive BBL titles. He took 15 wickets in the tournament, just one behind top wicket-taker John Hastings. His wickets came at an average of 16.73 and an amazing economy of just 6.27 runs per over. This proved to be the launch-pad that Behrendorff's career needed. At the 2014 Allan Border Medal ceremony, he was named the \"Domestic Player of the Year\". The final push would be in 2017 when he bagged figures of 9/37 in the first innings against Victoria, the fifth-best figures ever in the Sheffield Shield.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nDue to the wide array of options Australia had in the pace department, Behrendorff was unable to break into the squad. Finally, in August 2017, he got his lucky break. Jason was named in the national squad to face India. He made his T20I debut against India in October 2017 and had to wait for two years for his ODI debut.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nJason was also picked up in the 2019 ICC World Cup squad for Australia to partner Mitchell Starc. He took his first five-wicket haul against arch-rivals England in the group stage. However, England had the last laugh as they knocked out Australia in the semi-finals of the tournament. Following the World Cup, the 'Dorff' would be aiming to book his spot in all formats of the game for his national team.</p>",

Like thousands of others in his country, de Silva’s village was one of the many which were affected by the horrific Tsunami wave in 2005. That in itself is a tragedy massive enough to rock your whole world apart, but this young strong-headed boy at the time continued with his schooling and simultaneously, focused on his cricket as well.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nFollowing the pattern of a majority of cricketers in recent times, he broke through the ranks with some good performances in age-group cricket. A call-up in the U-19 squad followed along with a T20I debut in 2015. He impressed for a brief period, then went on to have a good domestic season which made it impossible to not take notice of him. ODI and Test debuts came the following year and he kicked his international career off in some fashion.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn his first ever Test series, which was against Australia at home, he was the highest run-getter. A stark highlight in it was his 211-run partnership with Dinesh Chandimal in the third Test, which bailed his team out of a tough spot and eventually, Sri Lanka went on to win the match. He made a decent start in the 50-over format as well, having scored a couple of strong fifties in his first few games, but then experienced a dip in form. He’s been in and out of the side a lot, largely down to inconsistency, and found it difficult to impress whenever given a chance.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nDhananjaya is an aggressive batsman with flair and good technique. He has been experiencing a low phase in his career, but he still has time on his side and the Lankans would be wise to persist with him as he has the talent and can be a vital part going forward in this rebuilding phase of theirs.</p>",

Having drafted into the Otago squad by coach Vaughn Johnston, the teenager from Southland Boys High School had a sensational beginning becoming the leading wicket-taker after just seven games in the country's premier T20 competition, the HRV Cup. Now 19, Duffy is still on the learning curve when it comes to the nitty-gritties of T20 cricket and would definitely look forward to the challenges lying ahead.</p>",

A promising season in 2014-15 promoted him up the ranks and soon he was selected in the national team after the retirement of Daniel Vettori post the 2015 World Cup.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nSantner is a utility cricket, who bowls left-arm spin and is quite handy with the bat. In his debut ODI series, Mitchell smashed Adil Rashid for 28 runs in an over and displayed his big-hitting prowess. Considered as the successor of Daniel Vettori, Santner caught attention worldwide after his devastating spell of 4/11 against India in the World T20 2016.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn November 2015, Mitchell Santner got the opportunity to make his first Test appearance against Australia and by doing so he also became the first player in history to debut in a Day-Night Test match. His knock of 71 in the Kanpur Test against the Indian spinners on a turning surface showed his ability to bat in different conditions.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nSantner was picked to play in the Indian T20 League by the Chennai franchise in 2018 and in the following year, he hit a last-ball six to win a thrilling game against Rajasthan. His international career has not taken off the way he would have liked to but given his talent, Santner is expected to achieve great success. </p>",

        "description": "<p>Standing at 6'6\" and weighing around 140 kilograms, Rahkeem Cornwall is a deceptively tall and imposing all-rounder for West Indies. He is nicknamed as cricket's man mountain and is consistent for his domestic team. Cornwall made his First-class debut for the Leeward Islands in 2014 against Jamaica and played a blinder of an innings in the second innings but was able to take only 1 wicket in the entire match. In 2016, Rahkeem was a part of WICB president's squad against the Indians and impressed immediately with a fifer.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nCornwall's performance was even better in the series against Sri Lanka where he picked up 23 wickets in four unofficial Tests. Rahkeem was part of the St Lucia Stars in the CPL and in what was a poor season for the team, Cornwall was the bright spot as he performed well with both bat and ball. The big man was the leading wicket-taker for the Leeward Islands in the 2018-19 Super 50 tournament and finished with 14 wickets in 8 matches. Rahkeem followed this performance with 54 wickets in the regional 4-day tournament helping his team to reach 3rd position in the table. Consistent performances in the domestic league led to his selection in the West Indies squad for the Test series against India in 2019. </p>",

Known to be in the same category as the 'coolest' VVS Laxman, Vihari has risen through the ranks slowly but made sure his rise didn't go unnoticed.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nVihari was a member of the Under-19 World Cup winning squad in 2012. Though he didn't have the numbers to press forward his case for the national team, he made sure he didn't waste time in pondering upon it too much. He worked hard on his skills and got a contract with the Hyderabad-based franchise in the Indian T20 League in 2013.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAfter showing promise with both bat and ball in the T20 tournament, he changed his allegiance to Hyderabad from Andhra Pradesh in the domestic circuit in 2016. He was given the reigns of the team as well. In the first 63 FC matches he played, he had a staggering average of 59.79 and the best of 302*, which came in the very season he switched. After a lot of hard work and perseverance, his outstanding 2017-18 domestic season where he scored 1056 FC runs at an average of 96 was hard to ignore.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHanuma was finally called to the Test squad in 2018 for the last two Tests in England. He made his debut against England in September and struck his maiden fifty in the very first outing. He also picked up three crucial wickets of Joe Root, Alastair Cook, and Sam Curran in the second innings to showcase his all-round utility. Since then, he has been almost a regular for India in this format, especially away from home.</p>",

        "description": "<p>JP Duminy’s career will be one which will be remembered for its unfulfilled potential. Marred by injuries and subsequently unable to reach the heights he was poised to, the southpaw’s flashy career leaves you for wanting more.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nFondly known as JP, South African cricketer Jean-Paul Duminy is renowned for his stylish batting, usually featuring in the middle order. However, success came to him rather late after his entry into the international circuit. He came into national prominence after exhibiting his vast potential in South Africa's Under-19 tour to England in 2003. A brief stint with his domestic team, the Western Province also strengthened his foundation for a national inclusion.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nDuminy debuted in ODIs in 2004, but his initial years were marked by more failure than success. However, he made a phenomenal start to his Test career, which coincidentally came to him because teammate Ashwell Prince was sidelined due to a thumb injury. A calm unbeaten 50 in the second innings of the first Test provided a good supporting role in helping South Africa chase down a mammoth target of 414 in Perth. A magnificent 166 in Melbourne followed in the very next match which pulled South Africa out of inertia and was vital to help South Africa achieve an important away series win.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThis point was where JP’s career kicked off. Soon, he became an integral part of the limited-overs side too. Not only with the bat, Duminy also started contributing with the ball with his more than handy off spinners. With a calm approach and elegantly skillful batting, Duminy has, over the years carved out a strong place for himself in the Protea side. He is a feisty fielder who is compared with the likes of AB de Villiers and Herschelle Gibbs. With fast hands, he’s a graceful player of the cover drive and square cut and also good with his wrists. However, the Australians exposed his weakness when they toured South Africa in 2009 when they bombed him with the short deliveries.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nLike every cricketer has his glorious ups and notable downs, the latter for the left-hander came in 2010 in whites. He continued to remain an integral part of the limited-overs setup, including the 2011 World Cup, but a string of single digit scores saw him being dropped from the Test side. It was a relatively long period for him away from Test match cricket, but JP kept his head down and worked hard. His efforts bore fruit as he was recalled into the side two years later in 2012. And his comeback was marked in stunning fashion. He scored a century against New Zealand and was a part of the team that took the Test mace under Graeme Smith’s leadership. His rise back up the ladder was cut short, however, when he tore his Achilles Tendon that saw him out of the game for about seven months.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nJP Duminy blew hot and cold the next year or so, though. He made his comeback just in time to be involved in the Champions Trophy in 2013. Barring that 150 against the Netherlands, he had a rather quiet tournament. 2014, though, was a fruitful year for him in Test cricket. Scored important tons against Australia and Sri Lanka, but his form started to wither away for some reason as the weeks passed by. His limited-overs prowess continued to shine when he aided South Africa to a T20 series win in 2015. Another injury forced him out of the team for a little while but his return wasn’t up to the mark. From being a pure batsman, the added responsibility of becoming an all-rounder clearly took its toll on him. His overall game was affected and he failed to be as impressive as he once was.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nDespite all this, JP still had a good chance to resurrect his career as he got the chance to bat at the No. 4 position for the most part of 2016 and 2017 in Tests in AB de Villiers’ absence. But he failed to make the most of it and after some consistent failures, he was released from the squad after the first Test itself against England in the middle part of 2017. Perhaps seeing little chance of getting back into the team, the southpaw announced his retirement from the longest format of the game.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nDuminy has also been a part of the Indian T20 league, initially representing the Mumbai franchise and later plying his trade for Hyderabad along with playing for Cape Cobras in South Africa's domestic T20 competition. In 2014, Duminy was bought by Delhi for INR 2.2 crores to play for them in the seventh edition of the Indian T20 League.</p>",

Under the captaincy of Shaun Pollock, South Africa suffered yet another setback in the 2003 ICC World Cup that they hosted. Pollock's resignation saw the rise of South Africa's greatest captains till date, Smith was handed the captaincy at a young age of 22. His captaincy and batting eased into a hand-glove combination for the team.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the 12 Test innings leading to his captaincy since his debut in 2002, opener Graeme Smith had already amassed scores of 200(his maiden Test ton) against Bangladesh and 151 against Pakistan. In the 22 parallel ODIs played during the time, he scored six fifties with a high-score of 99 against Sri Lanka. He didn't stop there, his best was yet to come. During South Africa's tour to England in 2003, he scored his highest Test score, 277 in his very first innings on English soil. An 85 in the second innings of the same Test was followed by another double century in the next game in which he scored 259. The world knew that a new force was here to stamp his authority. His dominant start gave no impression of beginner's luck or momentum carried on from a purple patch. The international circuit seemed Smith's habitat since day one.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen the inexperienced Smith was short-listed for captaincy and then appointed, criticism from various circles sprung into limelight. However, leadership triggered Smith to greater heights. En route, he also clinched a few individual records, elevating his batting performances to historic levels. ODIs reaped better results, most notably a historic 434-run chase against Australia in 2006. Seven Test series wins on the trot and a semi-final berth in the 2007 ICC World Cup led to the halting of South Africa's ebb. In the longer version, an away series draw in India failed to replace their opponents as the top Test playing side. Smith then stepped down as the T20I skipper in 2010, and also gave up his ODI captaincy post the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup. However, he continued to captain South Africa in Tests. He has also been a part of the IPL, first representing Rajasthan and later moving to Pune. More fame was in store for South Africa under Smith when the team toured England and beat them in a Test series to snatch the number one spot from their opponents and have it for themselves for a long time from there on. During the possession of the coveted position, Smith completed his 100th Test as a South African player as well as captain. It all came thick and fast for Graeme Smith. In modern-day cricket, no player ascended from being a 21-year old debutant to permanent captaincy by 22, after featuring in paltry eight Tests and 22 ODIs. Yet, it all worked out, restoring South Africa's high levels on the international stage and being one of cricket's most dangerous batsmen.</p>",

On a track that was dead as a dodo, Styris’ impressive 3-wicket haul was instrumental in a New Zealand win; but it was his eight wickets in the home series against West Indies in 2000 which hallmarked his arrival on the ODI stage. However the flipside of his impressive performances in the shorter format had its banes as Styris was branded by many as an ODI specialist and found it hard to break into the Test side. But when given a chance against the West Indies in mid-2002, Styris broke all myths scoring a ton on debut and went on to play a match-saving innings on the last day of the Test. From his first 15 Test matches, Styris scored four centuries which included a swashbuckling 170 against South Africa. He was no less impressive in ODIs contributing 101 in a then record ODI chase of 322 against Australia in 2005-06.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA back injury before the Sri Lanka series in late 2006 scuppered his progress but Styris came back invigorated and was one of the stars of the 2007 World Cup, playing a massive hand in New Zealand’s road to the semi-final. Loss of form combined with injuries resulted in him being dropped from the Test squad and after serious contemplation in 2008 he announced his retirement from Test cricket and first-class cricket to concentrate on the shorter formats of the game. Post New Zealand’s semi-final finish in the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup, Styris retired from all forms of international cricket, stating that he will continue to play domestic T20 tournaments. He was then usurped by the Deccan Chargers for the first few seasons of the IPL, followed by the Chennai Super Kings.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Following his Test debut in 2008, Graeme Swann's rise to the pinnacle of spin bowling has been mercurial. Despite not being the biggest turner of the ball, his ability to loop and drift it made the now-retired Swann a difficult bowler to tackle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe right-arm off-break bowler got his first taste of England action back during the turn of the millennium on tour to South Africa. An economical spell wasn't enough to earn a recall. During his 7-year long England hiatus, Swann impressed with both bat and ball for his county Nottinghamshire. His tally of 516 runs and 45 wickets in 2007 was finally deemed too good to overlook for an ODI return. 'Chin' as he is fondly nicknamed, won his maiden Test cap against India in 2008. He was summoned to bowl in tandem with ex-county team-mate Monty Panesar on a batsman-friendly Chennai surface and took four wickets over two innings in a comfortable Indian victory. With Panesar’s slow decline, Swann's performance simultaneously improved and in subsequent ODIs and T20Is against the likes of New Zealand, India and West Indies, he combined wickets with good economy to merit a call-up for the 2009 Ashes. His heroics in the series with both bat and ball became integral in England's 2-1 win.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the ICC World T20 event in 2010, Swann was the stand-out bowler for England, helping his country take home its first-ever ICC trophy. Later, in 2011, the off-spinner was handed England's T20 captaincy for their series against the West Indies, after the then captain Stuart Broad's niggling shoulder injury sidelined him for quite a while. He contributed heavily with a handy tally of wickets against India in England's historic tour of 2012 which they won 2-1. An elbow surgery early in 2013 kept Swann out of action for a while but he came back with strong numbers in England's 3-0 Ashes win at home.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA body prone to injury and a return Ashes that saw a dip in Swann's bowling form and England's losing the urn in the third Test in Perth, prompted the ace spinner to hang his boots from all forms of cricket. Swann stated that he was pretty satisfied with his career and confessed that he should have retired after the Poms won the Ashes earlier in the year. Since the series was lost mid-way, Swann sprung up a surprise retirement to allow other spinners to try and fill his boots.</p>",

Taufeeq made his Test debut in August 2001 against Bangladesh and grabbed the opportunity with both hands, scoring a century in the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe talent from Lahore continued his prolific form against top cricketing nations Australia and South Africa. He showed solid technique with shots off the back-foot as well as some sublime drives off the front-foot to score 88 against the Aussies and 135 against the Proteas. His limited opportunity in the 2003 World Cup spurred him on to achieve more in order to prove his worth and he did so by hammering a century and three fifties in four innings on home soil against South Africa.<br />\r\nHowever, Umar could not maintain the consistency of such knocks and soon found himself out of the national side. His involvement with the infamous rebel league stunted his international career growth and despite the scrapping of the league, Umar could not find his way back into the team, before he was eventually called up in 2010 for the South Africa series.</p>",

He retired from international cricket in 2013 and hours after his last game was conferred the highest civilian award in India, the Bharat Ratna, a first for a sportsperson.

        "description": "<p>Dominant, calm and deadly are just a few terms to describe one of England's most hard-hitting opening batsmen of all time – Marcus Trescothick. Known to display an astonishing amount of power when hitting a cricket ball, the left-handed Trescothick made the cut to play for the English cricket team in 2000 against Zimbabwe in an ODI. He made an immediate impact scoring 79 on debut and followed it up with a man of the match performance against Zimbabwe.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause of this blistering form, he was given a place in the Test side against West Indies in 2000 and went on to make another telling contribution. While early wickets fell, he stuck on and made a confident 66 in the company of Alec Stewart raising a partnership of 179 runs in the process. All the while, on the domestic circuit, Trescothick was going great guns for Somerset. However, his international form began to dwindle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2001, Trescothick was the second highest run getter for his country but he had a penchant to throw away his wicket when set. As a result of this, and of course the inability of the other Englishmen to score, Australia trampled all over them and cantered to a 4-1 series victory. Following the Ashes was a series in India where he batted his way back to form. He averaged 48 in the Test series with a high score of 99 and was easily England's best batsman in the ODIs with a more than healthy average of 53 and a strike rate in excess of 100. He scored his fourth international century in the first ODI but by this point, none of his centuries had resulted in an England win. He gained the reputation of England's best batsman against quality spin bowling.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2002, Trescothick suffered a fracture on his thumb and his season was cut short after a good start. In 2002-03, Trescothick's form suffered further and managed a measly average of 26.10 and was completely overshadowed by Michael Vaughan. The 2003 ICC Cricket World Cup also did not seem to motivate him to play better as he failed to help England qualify for the knock-out stages with a tournament average of only 23.20.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the third Test of the Ashes in 2005, Trescothick became the fastest batsman to reach 5000 runs and was the second highest scorer in the series behind Kevin Pietersen. This also meant that he had scored more than 1000 runs in a calendar year for the third consecutive time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHis problems began in 2006 when he returned home from the series against India citing a viral problem. He then came back to the subcontinent to play Sri Lanka and Pakistan and after heavy scoring initially, he faded into oblivion. It was later known that he was suffering from clinical depression. The England selectors however, never lost faith in him and named him in the squad for the ICC World Twenty20 in 2007. He pulled out of the tournament though stating that he needed more time to recover. Amidst all this, his good form in the domestic circuit for Somerset continued. Finally, in March 2008, Trescothick announced that he was retiring from all forms of international cricket. He still continues to play for and captain English county side Somerset.</p>",

The burly fast-bowler went on to play his first Test in 5 years against Pakistan in December 2009. The comeback was soon halted by a number of injuries, broken hand bones, strained biceps, etc. following which the veteran lost his central contract with New Zealand.

His career was over due to numerous disciplinary issues he had with the Zimbabwean Cricket Board.

A decade and half has followed since then, but Daniel Vettori continues to remain one of the best left-arm spinners in world cricket today.</p>\r\n<p>Vettori's talent was so evident in his very first season for Northern Districts that Kiwi selectors did not bat an eyelid before blooding him in the national squad when he was only 18. His first 10 Tests yielded 30 wickets and he also started finding his feet in ODIs. Though he continued to impress over the next two years, his claim to fame was to come in the Auckland Test against Australia in early 2000. Against a strong Baggie Green line-up, he prized 12 wickets and even though New Zealand lost the game, his performance did not go unnoticed. He again proved to be Australia's nemesis on the 2001 trip Down Under, picking up 5-wicket hauls in consecutive Tests.</p>\r\n<p>He suffered a dip in form in the 2003-04 season, but the southpaw returned to his old ways against Bangladesh with a rout of 20 wickets from 2 Tests. 2008, by far, proved to be his best year with 54 Test wickets and he was also elevated as the Black Caps' captain. Unfortunately, retirements and the Indian rebel league saga robbed him of key players and it was not until recently that he had a wider squadron of players to work with. Daniel Vettori started off his Indian T20 league career by playing for Delhi before moving onto Bengaluru.</p>\r\n<p>When compared to a Warne or a Muralidaran, Vettori is not a big turner of the ball but it is his variations in flight, line and length coupled with his ability to out-think and outfox batsmen that have made him so successful over the years. A very good lower-order batsman, he has played several match-winning and match-saving knocks for his team. With an extremely successful Test career and rather fulfilling captaincy tenure, 'Dan' stepped down from the post in Tests and retired from the shorter formats after the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup. Vettori's career since then, has been flagged by a dodgy knee that has been subjected to surgery but has not recuperated to complete fitness, keeping him out of action for New Zealand for nearly two years. Vettori however, represented Brisbane Heat in the Big Bash League for the 2013-14 season.</p>\r\n<p>With the 2015 ICC World Cup slated Down Under, skipper Brendon McCullum insisted that the Kiwi squad would be incomplete without the veteran and Vettori obliged, coming out of retirement. He finished the tournament in grand style, as the joint highest wicket-taker by a spinner. Vettori immediately called it quits post the World Cup.</p>",

He ended with 519 to his name.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, it was his gentlemanly spirit that stood out to the fore. In the 1987 World Cup, Walsh refused to run Saleem Jaffar out for backing too far, in turn losing an opportunity to win the match for his team. When he would beat the batsman, there would be no exaggerated lip service, just a raised eye brow, a shake of the head and he would be on his way back to the top of the bowling mark. And though, Walsh did not have the artistry beauty of a Holding, or the pace of Marshall, what he did have was the consistency in bowling delivery after delivery at the same spot and extracting bounce of the wicket due to his height. He had a hat trick to his name which was spread over two innings of a Test against Australia. However, if there was someone who was as bad with the bat as he was good with the ball, it had to be Walsh. His batting would bring a comic relief to those watching him play as his average of 7 and a collection of 40 odd ducks would portray.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWalsh retired at an age of 39, another indicator of the workhorse that he was, and West Indies have found it difficult to find a suitable replacement for him.</p>",

His ability to reverse swing the ball at a very high speed helped him to form the most effective fast bowling partnership with team-mate Wasim Akram in the 1990’s.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWaqar played a lot of first-class cricket for several cricket clubs in Pakistan, but attracted public eye when he first played for English county, Surrey in 1989-90. Discovered by Imran Khan, he soon made his international debut for Pakistan against India on 15th November 1989, the same day when India’s master baster Sachin Tendulkar also debuted. Within no time, he became a regular opening bowler in the side along with Akram and the duo was recognised as the most feared bowling attack. At a deadly pace of 153 km/h, he bowled the most disastrous Yorkers in cricket, aiming right at the stumps instead of the batsman, inspiring the next generation of bowlers such as Sri Lanka’s Lasith Malinga. His variation from inswingers to outswingers saw him becoming a successful wicket-taking bowler. He was titled as the “Banana Swing” bowler because of his technique of swinging the ball in the air at high speed before hitting the ground.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSuspension and disputes with team-mate Akram ruled Waqar out of action in early 2000. Upon his return, he captained Pakistan for a few years, but stepped down after his team’s terrible performance at the 2003 ICC Cricket World Cup. Unable to find lost form, Waqar retired from international cricket in 2004. He then served his country as their bowling coach since 2006, before being named as the head coach of the national team in 2010. The following year, he resigned citing personal reasons. However, a couple of years later, Waqar was appointed bowling consultant of the renamed IPL franchise, Sunrisers Hyderabad.</p>",

Picked out of nowhere, he went onto take ten wickets in the very second match he played in, and there was no looking back after that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStarting as an out and out raw pace bowler, he learnt the tricks of the trade by playing more matches, and soon cut his long run up to the wicket to just a few paces. What he missed out on pace, he more than made up by his swing, seam and the various things he could impart to the red cherry, befuddling almost every batsman that faced him. A proponent of reverse swing, his sweet-sour relationship with Waqar Younis did not deter the pair from capturing a whopping 1705 international wickets. Akram started out as a decent bat, but his batting soon fell away, and although he did score a match saving 257 – hitting 12 sixes in the progress – the inning was a one off.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAkram did captain the Pakistani side on many occasions but allegations of match fixing, injuries, and problems with diabetes did not help his cause too much, as he retired from the game in 2003. He then joined a sports channel as a commentator, and has been a regular in the commentary box, well known for co-hosting the Shaz and Waz show with co-commentator, Ravi Shastri.</p>",

        "description": "<p>When the chubby Shane Warne made his Test debut in 1992 against India, one wouldn’t have presumed the tremendous potential the leg spinner possessed. 145 Tests and 15 years later, the man had 708 victims in his kitty, taking over 1000 international wickets, only second to Sri Lanka’s Muttiah Muralitharan. His useful lower-order batting fetched him more than 3000 runs in Test cricket, without a single century. The more interesting part was the way he went about plotting the downfall of the batsmen, outwitting and out-thinking them into submission. Mike Gatting received what they later called the 'Ball of the Century', and for years after that, the Englishmen treated Warne as if he was a ticking bomb, waiting to explode. His bowling was a blend of simplicity and accuracy.</p>\r\n<p> <br />\r\nHowever, like any great cricketer, Warne had one Achilles Heel, and that was in the form of Sachin Tendulkar, for whom he once famously claimed that he had nightmares of Tendulkar dancing down the wicket and hitting him for a six. “Warney” as he is nicknamed, had his moments of glory but one thing that he would always regret is that despite being a solid performer, his controversies ensured that the Test captaincy was never going to be his. Warne and controversies always went hand-in-hand. In 2003, he was found guilty of breaching ACB’s drug code and a one-year ban was imposed on him. He returned to competitive cricket in 2004, which became the better phase of his career.<br />\r\n </p>\r\n<p>If anybody thought that one of the Wisden top 5 cricketers of the 20th century couldn't get any better, well, they had another thing coming. Warne's comeback in 2004 was as beautiful as the northern lights in the night sky. This was where he brought some variations into his bowling, with the flippers and the zooters and the sliders adding to his repertoire. His ability to adapt to the changing game helped him have a terrific end to his international career. Despite having an arsenal of deliveries in his armoury, he largely relied on his two old mates - the impeccable leg break and threatening accuracy. Shane Keith Warne was a real joy to behold during the last 2-3 years of his career.<br />\r\n </p>\r\n<p>Warne’s international retirement came in 2007, after Australia reclaimed the Ashes series of 2006-07, which was his ultimate goal. In March 2008, he signed to play for the Rajasthan in the Indian T20 League as their captain and coach and led the team to the title glory. Later, in 2011, he was retained by the Royals for both the roles, following which he announced his retirement from all forms of the game in 2012. His aggressive captaincy and superb man-management skills were so brilliant, that experts and former players alike went on to say that he was the greatest captain Australia never had. The man himself admitted in his autobiography that not captaining his country was one of his greatest regrets. </p>",

While his twin brother Steve was grit personified, Mark’s ability to unfurl breathtaking strokes with absolute ease was marvelous. ‘Junior’ as Mark is fondly called, made his international debut in 1988 in ODIs but didn’t quite set the cricket world on fire. However, his performances in the Australian domestic circuit saw him getting rewarded with a Test cap in 1991, as he replaced his twin brother in the squad.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nMark started his Test career with a bang, stroking a classy century on debut against England at the Adelaide Oval. The knock made the world to sit up and take notice of this dashing shot-maker who was a delight to watch when on song. His Test career motored along well and it also had a positive effect on his limited-overs game as he started performing consistently in ODIs too. While he batted in the middle order in the longer format, Mark utilized his stylish strokeplay to the maximum as an opener in the 50-over game.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe 1994-96 phase saw Mark at his absolute best as he was exceptionally consistent in both formats. The fact that his ODI career was in full swing was the pleasing aspect as he had established himself in Tests from the word go. Mark’s best two years in the 50-over circuit came in the World Cup years, 1996 and 1999, aggregating over 1000 runs both times at a healthy average. He was a man for big occasions, as his World Cup records show and relished playing under pressure. His batting prowess yielded 38 international centuries, more or less evenly distributed between the two formats.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nWhile his batting was a delight, Mark Waugh’s fielding was poetry to the eyes. A born athlete, the man could field anywhere with precision although his expertise was in the slip cordon where he ruled throughout his career. His catching was high class, making stunners look a piece of cake. Mark made his fielding seem too easy, much like his batting. Individual achievements apart, his best moment was undoubtedly that of being a World Cup winner in 1999 under his twin’s leadership. Post the title win, he continued to churn out runs consistently and seemed set to play the next edition that was to be hosted by South Africa in 2003.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHowever, things didn’t quite work out that way. Despite being in top form during the year 2001, he was unceremoniously dropped from the ODI side along with Steve the following year after Australia failed to make the final of the tri-series at home, enduring his slight lean patch with the bat. It was a painful anti-climax to the ODI careers of the famous twins who had served Australian cricket exceptionally over the years. Mark did turn to administration after his retirement and was appointed national selector in 2014. He still continues to hold that spot and has been a very popular man across the country regarding team selections. </p>",

His tough as nails attitude rubbed onto his teammates as well and as a skipper, he led from the front. He played plenty of game-changing knocks throughout his career.

Be it the partnership with Ricky Ponting in the super-six match against South Africa in the 1999 World Cup or ensuring his side kept its calm against the same opposition in the semifinal. Australia eventually went on to win the title and stamp their authority on world cricket. Although, Waugh was sacked in unceremonious manner after a poor show in the 2001-02 VB series, his form in whites never dipped as he led Australia to a record 16 wins in a row, including a whitewash against the West Indies.

This brought Weeraratne into the reckoning for the National team. Weeraratne made his ODI debut in the Asia Cup in 2000. He could not maintain his place in the side because of poor form and injury and did not play for almost five years after 2003.

As vice-captain, he scored three centuries in 2005, including a double hundred against India. Khan dominates spin bowling, and his trademark flick on the leg side is just one of an array of delightful strokes that he has mastered.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA classy batsman, he is an excellent exponent of classic stroke-play. He is also a skilful fielder, often stationed in the slips. Despite his obvious talent, the problems that have dogged Pakistan cricket have also followed Khan, perhaps inevitably, as he is a high-profile member of the team. Prior to 2007, he led Pakistan occasionally, but turned down the full-time role after a catastrophic World Cup. Pakistan continued to under-perform and in 2009, Khan gave it another shot at captaincy. Although he led Pakistan to victory in the World Twenty20, the captaincy came at a personal cost to him, as the team was later accused of match-fixing after the poor semi-final performance at that year's Champions Trophy; which ultimately led to his resignation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKhan's form deteriorated and after a horrendous tour of Australia in 2010, the Pakistan Cricket Board took the extraordinary step of banning Khan indefinitely for infighting. This was later overturned, but he was not recalled by the PCB as lingering antagonism between the two may have had a part to play, and it was not until October that he was selected against South Africa. After a prolonged absence from international cricket, his performances were impressive, scoring two fifties in ODIs and a hundred in his comeback Test. As Pakistan face struggles both on and off the pitch, a talented and experienced cricketer like him proves to be invaluable. However, the stress of cricket's bureaucracy and the burden of expectation placed on the team by Pakistani cricket fans may again be too much. Nevertheless, Khan's contribution towards his nation remains significant.</p>",

The onus, once again, fell on Mohammad Yousuf (nee Yousuf Yohanna) &ndash; already in at number 4 &ndash; to weather the storm.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor 9 years, since his debut in 1997, the cricketing world had witnessed art in motion through Yousuf. Each delivery bowled was welcomed with his upright stance, completely perusing its nature. Always seeming to have an extra moment before lowering his high and menacing back-lift, he&rsquo;d lean towards the ball precisely as prescribed to elegantly reveal his well-thought-out stroke. In them, the cleanness of strike evident, with technical proficiency only reminiscent in great batsmen of yore. It&rsquo;s what made every part of each inning seem fresh, irrespective of their stage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHad his footwork not been reluctant early in his innings, or had Yousuf&rsquo;s concentration not momentarily evade him (leading to erratic shot-making) soon after reaching scoring landmarks, one could watch him bat for all five days of a Test. That day at Lord&rsquo;s, neither folly invaded him. From 4-68, Pakistan were guided to 445, mere 83 shy of England&rsquo;s total, with Yousuf recording 202 to be the last man to fall. The Home of Cricket saw a performance worthy of its illustrious history.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHis arrival certainly helped transition from the dependable presence of Salim Malik and Ejaz Ahmed and re-establish Pakistan&rsquo;s middle-order along with Younis Khan and Inzamam ul-Haq. In 2006 itself, he&rsquo;d be crowned the year&rsquo;s best batsman. Enticement towards banned leagues (ICL, 2008) and allegations of catalyzing infighting (vs. Australia, 2010) would scar his career and even court short-term bans. Yousuf even retaliated the second of those bans by announcing his retirement, before being requested out of it. Two unsuccessful ODI World Cups would additionally deny Yousuf lasting recognition. But having played in times where the nature of cricket changed (for better or for worse), Mohammad Yousuf is one who helped define his generation of batsmen. That remains undoubted.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Not many batsmen capture imagination of a country like Yuvraj Singh did for India. The left-handed batsman’s elegance, agility and diligence to make an impact on the field caught the attention of everyone.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nSon of former India player Yograj Singh, Yuvraj was a child prodigy and made a name for himself courtesy of power-packed yet classy batting. He made big waves in the 2000 Under-19 World Cup by plundering plenty of runs as the team lifted the trophy. His talent didn’t go unnoticed as soon he was called up to the Indian team for the ICC Knockout trophy in Kenya in 2000. Playing only his second game, he scored a match-winning 84 against the likes of Glenn McGrath, Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie to show that he belonged to the big stage.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIt was during the NatWest final in 2002 against England that his resolve to fight it out came to the fore as he stitched a vital stand with Mohammad Kaif to take India to glory. Post that, he became a vital cog in the ODI side for India. He combined with Rahul Dravid and then MS Dhoni to finish games at will. He though could not break into the Test team which was filled with legends. He got limited opportunities and he did shine in those but could not make the most of them.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHis moment of real glory came in the ICC events. He was instrumental in India winning the 2007 World T20. His six sixes in an over to Stuart Broad are still being watched and nobody can forget the way he plundered the Australians for a 30-ball 70. His fielding proficiency, particularly when being deployed at point and his ability to roll his arm over effectively, made his value shoot up exponentially and was more than handy in the 2011 World Cup victory.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>Life was to change post that as Yuvi was diagnosed with an unfortunate, rare germ cancer which kept him out of action for more than a year immediately after the World Cup. However, India’s favourite son staged an inspirational comeback as he recovered in time ahead of the 2012 World T20. Sporadic performances and injuries meant he was in and out of the side. He had a forgetful time in the 2014 World T20 final against Sri Lanka and was eventually shown the door. It looked like that was it on the international stage for the now-paunchy southpaw.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn the Indian T20 League, he has traveled around quite a bit. Having started with Mohali, he could not light up the stage as expected and was later bought by Pune, Bangalore and eventually Hyderabad. He strung in few performances of note but has been struggling for consistency in a format he was touted to dominate.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nGoing back to domestic cricket, he had a brilliant Ranji Trophy in 2016-17 which led to the national selectors going back to him. He was recalled into the squad for the ODIs against England and in the second fixture itself, he combined with his finishing partner Dhoni to add more than 200 runs and bail India out of trouble. His contribution meant the faith of selectors was justified but with age catching up and youngsters performing consistently, Yuvraj will feel the need to keep getting the big scores to prolong his international career.</p>",

A week later, he was dropped from the side and with a young, fiercely talented Sangakkara who could make it to the team purely as a batsman taking up the gloves, Jayawardene could only make fleeting appearances and between 2000 and 2006 featured in only eight tests.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, with Sangakkara reluctant to don the wicket keeping role in Tests, Jayawardene was offered the position for the 2006 Test series against South Africa and immediately impressed with his natural ability to keep to both pacers and spinners.

He continued playing in Tests and though he did partake in a handful of ODIs, he failed to impress and is now regarded as a Test specialist. Over the years with Test tons against Bangladesh and India, Jayawardene has also shown steady improvement in his batting but with young, talented wicket-keepers like Dinesh Chandimal waiting in the ranks, Jayawardene will be well aware that he can't afford to let his guard down.</p>",

After playing only three ODIs and a solitary Test, Hauritz was dropped altogether and was left out in the wilderness. Brad Hogg and Stuart MacGill impressed during this period and it was not until four years later that he made a return against New Zealand, bagging four wickets in his comeback Test.

        "description": "<p>Shane Watson's well-built body, reminiscent of a wrestler or perhaps a boxer is just the tip of the iceberg when he meets one's eye on a cricket field. As intimidating as his presence or fitness may be, Watson was probably one of the most injury-prone cricketers but at the same time, he transpired into one of the leading all-rounders of his era.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nBorn in Queensland, 'Watto' first started playing for Tasmania at the age of 20. Topping the bowling charts in the Pura Cup and good middle-order performances led to his selection for Australia's tour of South Africa in early 2002. Though he did not live up to the expectations then, Ponting and the selectors opined that he was on a learning curve and it would only be a matter of time before he came good. He continued to be a regular member of the ODI team before an injury caused him to miss the 2003 ICC Cricket World Cup. He made a comeback a year later and started playing as a bowling all-rounder. Watson made his Test debut against Pakistan in 2005, scoring 31 in the first innings and taking a wicket. A dislocated shoulder while fielding in a Test against West Indies resulted in him missing the remainder of the season.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nLater, in the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy, Watson was given the chance to open the batting with Adam Gilchrist. The move paid rich dividends as he performed quite well with both bat and ball in the tournament, bagging the MOTM award in the finals which Australia won. In 2007, another injury blighted his progress and questions were raised about his ability to handle the workload expected from an all-rounder.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe 2008 edition of the Indian T20 League proved to be a turning point in his career. He was instrumental in Rajasthan's win in the inaugural season, being adjudged the Player of the Tournament. Since then, he regularly featured in Australia's Test, ODI and T20I squads and was a consistent performer. In 2013, when Clarke got injured, he became Australia's 44th captain in Tests but faced a humiliating defeat against India in Delhi. After the end of their disastrous Test tour to India in 2013, he gave up the vice-captaincy role. The following year, he was signed by the Sydney Sixers ahead of the first-ever Big Bash League and the Champions League T20.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nWatson kept on delivering his art. One of his most memorable ODI innings came against Bangladesh in 2011, when he thrashed the opposition bowlers, scoring an unbeaten 185, which included 15 fours and 15 sixes - a record at that time. The 2014 season of the Indian T20 League saw Shane Watson not only retained by his franchise, Rajasthan but also made the captain as Rahul Dravid retired after the 2013 season. It was the best replacement, as Watson was an established player himself and the one who enjoyed leadership. He had a consistent season, which resulted in yet another Player of the Tournament award, thereby becoming the first player to win this twice in the Indian T20 League. In 2015 BBL, he helped the Sydney Thunder win the league under his guidance and in the following year was signed by Bangalore as Rajasthan faced a ban for two years.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nShane Watson retired from the longest format of the game after Australia lost the 2015 Ashes and was ignored by the selectors in most of the ODIs on the same tour. He though continued to play in the T20 format and also led his country against India in January 2016 in the absence of Aaron Finch. There he scored an unbeaten 124 and received the Man of the Match award for it but in a losing cause. The same year in the World T20, he decided to hang up his boots from international cricket at the end of the campaign. His stint in the international arena was overshadowed by the brilliant Australian team of the early 2000s and his injuries. Yet, he came through and will be remembered as one of the finest all-rounders of the game, especially in the shorter formats.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nPost-retirement, in the 2017 Indian T20 league, Watson was appointed as the captain of Bangalore for the first few matches during the absence of regular captain Virat Kohli. In 2018, when Rajasthan and Chennai returned to the League after serving their ban, Rajasthan did not retain Watson and he was bought by Chennai for that season. In the finals, after being unable to get off the mark in the first 10 balls, Watson showed great fightback and ended up with a hundred in that innings, which was his fourth ton in the Indian T20 League. His knock helped Chennai in winning the title for the third time and he was awarded the Man of the Match in that game. Watson has been a regular in various T20 Leagues across the globe like the Pakistan Super League, Big Bash League, Caribbean Premier League and a few more.</p>",

However, he was recalled into the national side in the 2008 Asia Cup and he responded with his maiden ODI century, batting at No. 6. Unfortunately, he joined the rebel league, which put an end to his international career and also resulted in a 10-year ban. Soon, he quit the rebel league in 2009 and made himself available for national selection.<br />\r\n </p>",

However, it was his impressive work behind the stumps coupled with selectors looking to reduce the enormous workload on Andy, which saw the glove man getting an extended run in the team. Their faith was repaid as the youngster showed first signs of his improved batting with a half century in a Test against Pakistan. But his work behind the stumps grabbed all eyeballs, as with his quick reflexes, acrobatic abilities and awareness of situations, Taibu had a knack of creating something from nothing. He soon became integral to the Zimbabwean team featuring in the 2003 ICC Cricket World Cup and following Heath Streak’s shock resignation from captaincy in 2004, was handed the reins. He went on to have a disastrous outing as captain, leading a team replete with rookies and it signified one of the worst phases in Zimbabwean cricket.

Price wasn't a huge turner of the cricket ball but it was his clever thinking and subtle variations of pace and flight which devoured most batsman. Ray Price then went into an exile before coming back strongly in 2009, picking up 44 wickets in the year.

However few cease to remember the year 2003 when a teenage Thushara had made his Test debut against the same opponents.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe left armer who made his first-class debut in the 1998-99 season impressed selectors during his stints at Sri Lanka’s premier fast bowling academy and was consequently selected for the tours of South Africa and West Indies against whom him he made his Test debut, but apparently with little success. Left in the wilderness thereafter, in the following years Thushara struggled in the domestic arena but a fine run in the 2007-08 ‘Inter-Provincial Limited Overs Tournament’ where he helped club Kandurata finish as podium winners, once again brought him into national reckoning. However this time around, “Mirando” as he is lovingly called, took to the stage with much more self belief and it showed in his performances as he prized a memorable fiver in an ODI against the Indians and also excelled in the Test arena against the likes of Pakistan and New Zealand.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith an enviable height, Thushara is capable of generating disconcerting bounce and is also a handy hitter lower down the order. However, Sri Lanka’s problem of plenty has meant that Thushara has to continue performing consistently over a longer period to impress the captain and selectors to grant him a place in the starting eleven on a regular basis.</p>",

His ability to swing the ball away, coupled with his unusual batting style and a smile wider than anyone else’s, made him a favourite among the crowds. His career took a back seat when he was hit by a threatening injury in 2005. Balaji made a roaring comeback after a successful surgery and performed brilliantly in the first season of the IPL in 2008, where he scalped 11 wickets for Chennai, along with the first hat trick of the Indian T20 League. He was also instrumental in taking Tamil Nadu through to the semi-final of the Ranji Trophy with 36 wickets at 17.50 that marked his return to domestic cricket.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2009, Balaji was recalled into the ODI team for the series in Sri Lanka since his debut in 2002, as a replacement for injured Munaf Patel and was also included in the Test squad for the New Zealand tour. His quick-arm bowling action has been difficult to tackle for most batsmen. Bouncers, yorkers, everything came out of his bag without a noticeable change in action. His tendency to bowl wide from the crease made the batsmen believe that the ball was coming in, when it actually swung away.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBalaji represented Chennai for the first three seasons of the Indian T20 League, but in 2011 he was signed by Kolkata. He had a satisfying season with the franchise in 2012 and that quickly earned him a place in the Indian T20I squad for the World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka. He played his last international for India in the tournament. In the 2014 auction, Balaji was purchased by Mohali, the third franchise he represented in the Indian T20 League.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Nicknamed as the “King of Swing”, James Anderson is arguably the best pace bowler in swinging conditions. His ability to swing the ball both ways makes him even more deadly. Not many would believe but he came into the international side without a single county appearance. His performances for Burnley Cricket Club were all that spoke for him when the highest level of cricket beckoned. As with contemporaries like Shoaib Akhtar and Brett Lee, his speed was enough to unsettle the very best.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHe made his debut in the year 2002. His sensational spell (10-2-29-4) came in the World Cup 2003 against Pakistan but such was his consistency level at that time that he was more often seen coming in and going out of the side. At an early age it didn’t seem like he was in for a long haul but the year 2007 brought immense glory to his life and turned things drastically.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIt was under Andy Flower's guidance that England's golden boy came of age, recording his 100th ODI and Test wickets against India and South Africa in 2007 and 2008 respectively. Later in 2009, he featured in all five Ashes Tests resulting in England's retention of the coveted urn. By 2010, 'Jimmy' had become an England regular, taking wickets in bulk in both forms of cricket.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHe continued to make merry with the ball as in the 2013 Champions Trophy vs Australia, he became England’s leading ODI wicket-taker, going past Darren Gough’s tally of 234 scalps. Anderson, then, subjected a weak Australian batting to sharp conventional and reverse swing during the 2013 Ashes in England. However, he could do little harm to the strengthened and determined Aussies during the return Ashes, Down Under, in the same year when England surrendered 5-0.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nOff the field, Anderson enjoys great popularity, thanks to his attractive hairstyles and good looks. Dubbed the David Beckham of cricket, he once posed naked for Attitude, Britain’s best-selling gay magazine. In 2014, he also launched his own fashion brand in collaboration with Chess London.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nNot only with the ball, Anderson is quite handy with the bat down the order. He held a world record of going through 54 Test innings without a duck. His batting skills were further seen in the year 2014 against Sri Lanka where he batted for 55 deliveries and nearly saved a Test match for his side before getting out on the penultimate ball. Post that series, he impressed one and all with the willow against India as he was involved in a record last-wicket partnership worth 198 runs with Joe Root. He also registered the highest score for an England No. 11. Apart from all this, he is a very handy fielder, especially in catching positions.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nFor his immense contribution, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2015. He came back from an injury in the same year and played a tri-series in Australia involving India. He led the pace attack for his side in the 2015 World Cup which turned out to be an embarrassing one for the Englishmen as they were knocked out in the group stages itself. Post the WC, England started hunting for young players and it meant that Anderson wasn’t seen further in the colored clothing. However, he continued to be the mainstay of their bowling attack in Test cricket.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nWith age picking up, Anderson cut down on his speed and decided to concentrate on line and length and wickets followed in heaps. He also has a bit of a reputation for being a man not to shy away from playing mind games and exchange a few words with his opponents.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn 2016, Anderson became the first fast bowler to take 50 wickets against all other seven major Test-playing nations, further demonstrating his dominance at the highest level. In September 2017, all eyes were on him as he inched closer to achieve another milestone under his belt - 500 Test wickets! He bowled a deadly spell to take 7 wickets against West Indies at Lord’s in the second innings of the third Test, which also happened to be his career-best figures. Kraigg Brathwaite was his 500th victim as Jimmy became 6th overall and third pacer after McGrath and Walsh to achieve this feat. He continues to hold the record of being the leading wicket-taker for England and it would require some sensational stuff to go past him.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn 2018, during England's tour of New Zealand, Anderson set another historic record by becoming the leading pace bowler in Test history in terms of balls bowled. Jimmy faced India in the 2018 Test series at home and in the second Test of the series, he bagged figures of 5/20 in the first innings, resulting in him breaking multiple records - 100th Test wicket at Lord's and his 550th wicket overall. The biggest achievement of all for Anderson came in the fifth Test when he surpassed the Australian great, Glenn McGrath's record of 563 wickets to become the most successful pace bowler in Test history.</p>",

Paltry scores notwithstanding, Clarke’s debut was deemed good enough to earn him a scholarship from the Australian Cricket Academy and he went on to captain Australia’s Under-19 team. After slamming two consecutive centuries for NSW in 2002, he was selected for Australia A's tour to England. Claiming the second best average in the consequent South African tour, he became a hot topic for discussion in cricketing circles.</p>\r\n<p>With the 2003 ICC Cricket World Cup just round the corner, Australia chose to experiment and Clarke was handed his ODI debut. He responded to the call with an unbeaten 39 helping Australia beat England by four wickets. Clarke displayed exemplary technique and seemed to enjoy himself on the big stage, which was uncharacteristic of someone who was barely finding his feet in international cricket. With consistent performances in ODIs, he finally earned his Test call-up in an away series to India in 2004. Pup couldn’t have asked for a tougher litmus test with Australia in a spot of bother at 4-149, with a vociferous crowd egging on the Indian team to go for the kill. But he relished the opportunity, scoring a brilliant 151 on debut to earn the Man of the Match award. He played a crucial role with both bat and ball and helped Australia achieve a series win on Indian soil in over 30 years. His dream start continued as he slammed another hundred against New Zealand in Brisbane and was touted as Australia’s future batting superstar.</p>\r\n<p>An excellent fielder and a useful left-arm spinner, Clarke’s meteoric rise continued as he was part of Australia’s World Cup winning team in 2007. After Australia’s dream of a fourth successive World Cup victory was shattered by India in the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup, Ricky Ponting stepped down from captaincy. Clarke was immediately named Australia’s full-time captain in ODIs and Tests. However, he gave up T20Is to concentrate on longer formats.</p>\r\n<p>Clarke broke a 76-year old record for an Australian captain to score a triple century at home in Tests, when he scored 329* against India at the SCG in 2012. He went on to have a fabulous year ahead, becoming the only Test batsman to score four double centuries in a calendar year – a world record on its own!</p>\r\n<p>Clarke was signed by Pune Warriors for the fifth season of the Indian T20 League but was ruled out due to injury the following year. One of the best players of spin bowling, Clarke has been the cornerstone of the Australian side after the retirement of Ponting and his desire to improve at each and every stage of his career, as a player and a captain, has done wonders to the national side.</p>\r\n<p>After having survived a torrid summer in 2014-15 which began with the passing away of fellow compatriot Phillip Hughes, Michael Clarke fought his way through, combating a career-threatening back injury. He however, fought like a warrior and saw Australia through to their fifth World Cup title and called it quits from ODI cricket after the dream was achieved.</p>",

Yet, in an Indian top order that underwent immense experimentation between Ganguly, Sehwag, Tendulkar and Dravid; Gambhir always floated around the periphery. The same unsettled top order was a part of India's poor showing in the 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup, in which Gambhir didn't feature. He returned as a part of the young Indian side that won the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 the same year. It started an ascendancy of orbital proportions for both India and Gambhir. After being given an extended opportunity to partner Sehwag in both forms of the game, he started to blossom.<br />\r\n </p>\r\n<p>Gambhir was involved in India's first victory in New Zealand in four decades, in addition to his role in denying Australia bragging rights in the Border-Gavaskar trophy. To top that, there were the series victories against the touring Sri Lankan and English sides. The man they fondly call 'Gauti' excelled in these outings as he mastered the art of facing spin bowling and formed one half of what became one of the most dominating opening partnerships in modern cricket. He was a part of the historic Indian team that won the ICC Cricket World Cup in 2011 and his solid contribution in the final against Sri Lanka will never be forgotten. Unfortunate to miss out on what could have been a memorable century, that knock of 97 will still rank highly as one of the best in World Cup history. <br />\r\n </p>\r\n<p>He started the Indian T20 League with the Delhi franchise but after three seasons, he moved out to Kolkata where he got a chance to lead the side. His leadership saw them lift their first League title in 2012 and many players in the side lauded him as an astute leader. His international career took a downward spiral in early 2013 and he was left out from all formats of the game. <br />\r\n </p>\r\n<p>Gambhir didn't give up and kept working hard in domestic cricket. He performed brilliantly in the 2016 Duleep Trophy and was tough to ignore. An untimely injury to KL Rahul in the New Zealand series meant Gambhir returned to the national team after a gap of two years. However, his comeback didn’t last long as just after two Test matches, he once again was dropped. It would be interesting to see if the southpaw, known for his grit and determination can make another comeback.</p>",

He still battled it out for his county side Yorkshire and his best came in the 2005 and 2006 where he scored 1425 runs at an average of 59.37 and 1293 runs at an average of 61.57 respectively. He was again made the captain of Yorkshire in 2009 but was then replaced by Andrew Gale after just one season. The Yorkshire stalwart finally called it quits to his 17-year long career in 2013.</p>",

The opposition was New Zealand, and the Kiwis were left confounded by his century-on-debut that ensued.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy 2005, Strauss, with partner Trescothick, became England&rsquo;s crown jewel in reclaiming the Ashes after a gap that spanned two decades. Despite being his maiden encounter against Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath, his gritty batting peppered with tentative stroke-play notched two centuries over five Tests. Eventual comparisons to Justin Langer seemed inevitable. In 2006, Strauss was made interim ODI captain against Sri Lanka, following injuries to Michael Vaughan and Andrew Flintoff. That maiden foray into authority saw England suffer a series whitewash. Prolonged trust in Strauss was soon rewarded with a Test series victory against Pakistan, before captaincy returned to Flintoff. But the year saw a steady decline in his form, reflecting in England&rsquo;s 5-0 Ashes whitewash.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe lowest ebb resulted in an omission following below-par performances against the Windies and on tour to India. Before the final innings of a forgettable 3-Test series in New Zealand, Strauss&rsquo;s fate was pretty much sealed. But a timely 177 at Napier not just bought him time, but also paved way for a revival. The years that followed saw Strauss recapture both forms and captaincy &ndash; this time England looking to him to reunite a divided dressing room. In Alastair Cook, he found an opening partner to match the now-retired Trescothick. His leadership was instrumental in England retaining the 2009 and the 2010-11 Ashes proved even more special, as it was the first English victory on Australian soil after 24 long years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe impact of Strauss&rsquo; inspirational captaincy was largely evident when England were crowned World No.1 in the ICC Test Rankings in 2011. Under his tutelage, the English team humiliated the then World Champions India, beating them 4-0 to acquire the mace. However, their reign couldn&rsquo;t last for more than a year as a determined South Africa dethroned England from the pinnacle of Test cricket in 2012. Strauss then stepped down from captaincy, after playing his 100th Test at the Home of Cricket, his 50th as the England skipper. Not only did he resign from the post, but also announced his retirement from all forms of the game, paving way for his opening partner Alastair Cook to fill a huge void in the team.</p>",

An important member of the Kings XI Punjab in the Indian T20 League, he was ruled out of action after the 2010 season. However, he returned in 2011 and was signed by the Delhi Daredevils. Irfan impressed in the 2011-12 Ranji season, which earned him a recall into the ODI side for the final two games against West Indies. The following year, though, was fruitful as he emerged as the highest wicket-taker in the ODI series against Sri Lanka after being included in the ODI squad. That performance did a world of good to him, granting him a deserving place in the 2012 World Twenty20 squad. In March 2013, he made a comeback from his knee injury that kept him out for majority of the 2012-2013 Ranji season. He will be representing the Hyderabad franchise in the 2014 Indian T20 League. Pathan has been in fine form off late. He managed to pick up 7 wickets in 4 matches in a domestic T20 tournament.</p>",

He had a bright start to his first-class career as in just his first season, he won the best bowler award in the 2002-03 domestic competition, scalping 61 wickets, he grabbed three five-wicket hauls, including one 10-wicket haul. The Sri Lankan selectors took notice of his domestic performances and he was rewarded with a place in the ODI squad for the home series against England in 2003. He had an excellent debut against England picking up two wickets. But things went downhill from there on and after an unimpressive Test debut against New Zealand in 2005 he was dropped from both Test and ODI squads. His comeback wasn't a fairytale though. Only after a handful of games he was dropped again but with the World Cup around the corner, the selectors gave him another chance and with impressive performances, he earned his place in Sri Lanka's 2007 World Cup squad.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nDropped in the aftermath of the World Cup, he staged a brilliant comeback, taking 47 wickets in 11 months since April 2008 which propelled him to the number one spot in the ICC ODI Rankings in 2009. In 2011, he was selected to represent Chennai in the Champions League T20 in place of injured Tim Southee. In 2013 a splendid spell of swing bowling saw him scalp his first ODI five-for as he decimated the Australian top-order with consummate ease in Brisbane. Not only with the ball but he also developed as a handy lower-order batsman. With his big-hitting abilities, he can play the pinch-hitter's role too which he exhibited successfully in the 2013 Champions Trophy match against England, blasting 58 from 38 balls to power Sri Lanka to a victory along with Sangakkara.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nNuwan made his reputation as a whole-hearted bowler, forever eager to offer his services whenever the captain needed him. Along with the traditional swing, he can reverse swing the old ball too with his nagging accuracy which made him a dangerous proposition for any opposition. His career though slowly started to lose steam and he fell out of the radar of the Lankan selectors. He last played an international match in 2017 and after getting ignored for a long time, Nuwan decided to call it quits soon after the 2019 Cricket World Cup. At the time of his retirement, Kulasekara was the third leading wicket-taker for Sri Lanka (pacers) with 199 ODI wickets.</p>",

Ironically though, despite scoring tons of runs in the domestic circuit, Hussey had to wait till the age of 28 to make his international debut, thanks to the embarrassing problem of plenty in the Australian line-up through those years. But he grabbed the few opportunities presented to him and carved out a niche for himself on the world cricket stage. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA left-handed batsman, Hussey is in the mould of a Michael Bevan. He generally prefers to play off the back foot and has a tendency to charge down the wicket to spinners. He is predominantly a leg-side player and looks to accumulate runs rather than going for big shots. Despite commendable performances for Western Australia in his early years, Hussey failed to break into the Australian setup, a fact which influenced him to move to English county Northamptonshire in 2001. After three successful seasons there, he moved onto Gloucestershire in 2004 and Durham the following year. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter excelling in the ING Cup in the 2004-05 season, Hussey was awarded a central contract by Cricket Australia. He made his ODI debut against India in 2004. His talent was evident and many argued as to why be a player of such caliber kept waiting in the wings for such a long time. The elusive Test spot, however evaded him. A rib injury to Justin Langer paved the way for Hussey’s Test debut against the West Indies at the Gabba in 2005. After an ordinary first Test, he scored an unbeaten century in his second and has since played few memorable innings in the middle-order. His knock against Pakistan in the 2010 World Twenty20 semi-final is still remembered for its sheer brilliance where he led Australia to an improbable victory. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor any cricketer, the hardest thing to do is to leave the game he loved so much and for Hussey, that moment came in early 2013 when he decided to hang his boots from international cricket.<br />\r\nSince the inception of the Indian T20 League in 2008, Hussey has been a tremendous servant for the Chennai franchise leading them to title win in 2010. The same year, he was instrumental up the order guiding Chennai to a Champions League T20 title as well. Post retirement, his new book courted controversy with comments regarding his Indian T20 League owners Chennai’s involvement in the much-talked about match-fixing allegations. The following year, Chennai did not retain him nor did they bid for him in the auction. Chennai’s loss was Mumbai’s gain who bought the iconic batsman for 5 crores.</p>",

The next two years were not as fruitful as injury, followed by a poor 2007 World Cup, marred his progress.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn 2010, Bravo turned down a WICB central contract, preferring to play several T20 Leagues around the globe. He lost his place in the Test side but remained a regular fixture in the T20Is. He was signed up by Mumbai in the inaugural edition of the Indian T20 League and performed exceedingly well. Later, Chennai bought him in 2011 and he has been with them ever since. Before the Champions Trophy in 2013, Bravo replaced Darren Sammy as the ODI captain.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nA middle-order batsman, Bravo with his stylish cover drives and quick feet movement, exhibits the true Caribbean flavour. He is also a brilliant fielder and brings energy to the West Indian outfit with his acrobatic fielding. A more than useful death-overs bowler, Bravo has clever variations up his sleeve and also has one of the best slower balls in the business.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHe was the player's spokesperson when West Indies refused to play their games during a tour of India in 2014 due to issues with the board. Post that, he faced injuries and was eventually left out of the squad as Jason Holder was made the skipper of the ODI team. Bravo then announced his retirement in Tests in 2015. He went on to participate for his country in ODIs and T20Is, even winning the World T20 title in 2016. His injuries and form caused his representation for the national team reducing and eventually, he started playing more in the T20 Leagues around the world.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nBravo bid the final goodbye to international cricket when he announced his retirement on 25th October 2018. He still remains an exciting and internal part of the Chennai unit as well as the other T20 franchises in the world. The all-rounder will always remain as one of the best advertisements of the sport, be it due to his joyful nature, his funny antics or for showing superb sportsman spirit.</p>",

He is an aggressive batsman, demonstrated by his big hitting. He normally bats in the middle order and places his innings to perfection. The ability to clear the fence easily makes him a dangerous prospect for any opposition in the death overs. Chigumbura has also proved to be a more-than-useful pace bowler and though he gives away runs, he has this uncanny knack of picking up wickets at regular intervals. The all-rounder from Kwekwe is known to be nimble in the field and has a safe pair of hands.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the increasing politicization of Zimbabwean cricket and the sacking or retirement of many experienced players, the team  performed poorly over several years. Never a strong team, in recent years, even wins against minnow nations were not guaranteed. It was in these state of affairs that Chigumbura was entrusted with captaincy in 2010. But, after a dismal show at the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup, the captaincy changed hands as Chigumbura was replaced with Brendan Taylor, a move that signaled Zimbabwe's return to Test cricket in the same year to face Bangladesh at home. </p>",

After being left out in the wilderness till 2007, he staged a sensational comeback picking up 8 wickets, which included figures of 7/66 in the second innings, in his debut Test against England in Manchester. Inconsistency in the longest format of the game meant that he struggled to seal a permanent place but was a mainstay in the limited overs internationals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSammy's leadership skills were also on show as he led the side against Canada in only his 37th ODI and later in the T20I format. After a good outing in the 2010 World Twenty20, he scored the fastest fifty for West Indies in ODIs. Coming in at No.9, he nearly pulled off a miraculous chase with a 24-ball 58-run innings. He was handed over the captaincy reins in October 2010 after Chris Gayle did not sign a central contract in 2010. With the added pressure of batting and bowling, Sammy led the team to a disappointing World Cup in 2011, but a few months later, he helped West Indies achieve their first Test victory in two years, against Pakistan. More laurels followed, as he led the Caribbean men to their first-ever World Twenty20 title in 2012. The following year, Sammy was bought by Hyderabad for the sixth Indian T20 League season. He was later removed as the ODI captain for the Champions Trophy but retained as Test and T20I skipper.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTest captaincy hasn't been the best for the power-hitter as West Indies have been dominated by every opposition they have played against. T20Is have been the only format in which West Indies have been consistent. After winning the 2012 World T20, they reached to the semi-finals of World T20 in Bangladesh. Captain Sammy has always been impressive with his batting rather than his bowling as the lusty blows once connected, stay hit. Sammy was retained by the Hyderabad franchise when they used the 'Right to Match' card for him at a price of Rs. 3.5 Crores in the seventh season of the Indian T20 League.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSammy also led West Indies to another victorious World T20 campaign in 2016 when his team beat England at the Eden Gardens.

        "description": "<p>This right-handed stylish batsman from Coventry, England, was already a star, long before he even actually made it to the national team, receiving praise from the likes of Dayle Hadlee at the age of 16. Known to be a highly talented batsman, Ian Bell is one of the few English players who has established himself in all formats of the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBell got his first call-up to the England squad in 2001 after playing just 13 first-class games. However, he made his Test debut as late as August 2004 against the West Indies. 'Belly' became an instant star scoring 70 on debut and was given an opening to the ODI circuit against Zimbabwe later that year where he impressed once again scoring 75 bagging the 'Man of the Match' award for his efforts. His first big slump in international cricket came against arch-rivals Australia where Glenn McGrath and the likes restricted him to a paltry 171 runs in 10 innings. Bell recovered rapidly from the fall and turned out to be the highest run-scorer in the subsequent series against Pakistan.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe middle-order batsman received a lot of flak for not converting starts into big innings and was doubted by most cricketing experts who pondered whether he had the talent to get to the three-figure mark. One of his characteristics was to get out softly, especially after getting himself set at the crease. A solid 110 against New Zealand and a stunning 199 against South Africa in 2008 silenced critics in an emphatic manner. He was dropped in the winter after a poor first Test against West Indies but soon restored his place in the side and went on to score a match-winning 140 against South Africa at Durban.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOver the years, Ian Bell has become one of England's most reliable middle-order batsmen in Tests and when he was sent up to be a regular opener in ODIs, he was seldom disappointing. Ian Bell's stature in the England team went up a notch when he was England's run-piler in the home Ashes series in 2013 during which he became the first man since Chris Broad in 1986 to reach triple figures in three consecutive Ashes Tests. The return Ashes saw the Poms lose the urn to the Aussies through a clean-sweep and Bell failed to blossom with the bat, scoring just two half centuries in the series. Now a senior member of the side, a lot of responsibility rests on Ian Bell's shoulders and he has carried the burden rather appreciably.</p>",

After four mandatory years of county, the predestined England call-up quickly arrived in 2004.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDebuting on tour to Zimbabwe, Pietersen's 104 runs in three ODI innings were enough to retain his place in the one-day side for the series against South Africa and Australia-Bangladesh. Consistent ODI performances advocated a Test call-up for the 2005 Ashes. His fearless stroke-play made him the top-scorer in the series, playing a major role in England reclaiming the Ashes for the first time in two decades. Consistent performances in 2007 cemented his place in all forms of the game. A strong player on the drive, KP is a beautiful player of the hook and pull as well while his signature 'Flamingo' shot and the switch-hit is a spectator's delight.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen Michael Vaughan and Paul Collingwood gave up their roles as captains in the longer and shorter forms of the game respectively, the role was offered to Pietersen. Defeat in his first Test as captain was overcome when he led England to a 2-1 ODI series win at native South Africa. Backroom differences with the then coach Peter Moores led to Moores' sacking and Pietersen's resignation, ending his short stint as captain. An achilles injury served as a much needed break in his rigorous career, and he made a successful England return for retaining the Ashes in 2009. The year proved additionally fruitful when he was again one of the star performers in England's ICC World T20 win in 2010. What followed was a successful 2010-11 Ashes campaign down under, where he ended a 20-month long wait for an international ton with his first double century and followed it up with an Ashes win in Australia in 24 years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKP was unfortunately ruled out of the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup due to a hernia injury, which subsequently made him unavailable for that year's Indian T20 League. However, in 2012, he was transferred to Delhi from his former franchise, Bangalore. In the English summer of 2012, during South Africa's tour to the country, he was marred with a few controversies which got him dropped from the third Test. Further contract-related issues led to his immature retirement from ODIs which he later revoked. All issues sorted and buried, he was picked for England's successful tour of India where he scored a series-turning century in Mumbai that helped England win the first of their two Tests. The following year, he was once again ruled out of the Indian T20 League following a knee injury picked up during England's tour of New Zealand. Pietersen then returned for the Ashes in July 2013 and scored a sparkling century in the third Test at Manchester. Pietersen completed his 100th Test during the first Test of the return Ashes later that year but had a substandard series although he was the top run-getter for England who lost the urn through a 5-0 whitewash.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe fallout of the Ashes resulted in the ouster of coach Andy Flower and Pietersen’s relationship with the ECB management came in question once again. The ECB decided not to include KP on the tour to West Indies in February 2014 and speculated that it could well be the end for KP as an English cricketer. Pietersen himself made a statement in the matter, ‘Although I am obviously very sad the incredible journey has come to an end, I'm also hugely proud of what we, as a team, have achieved over the past nine years.’ In the same month, Pietersen landed a contract with the Delhi franchise for the 7th edition of the Indian T20 League and was also made captain of the team.</p>",

It often forced him into an ultra-defensive mode, carefully choosing deliveries to entertain his willow, a weakness that bowlers initially suspected. He was given time to iron out flaws just like his South African side circa 2006. It took another 11 Tests since that 149 for Amla to post a second ton, once again facing New Zealand at home in late 2007 at Johannesburg. It was the first of two consecutive hundreds, opening floodgates in the process.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nCenturies in India and England a year later marked his adoption to the highest level, atoning for poor displays in those very foreign soils earlier in his career. It also sparked an ODI call-up against Bangladesh in 2008, a position he hasn't relinquished since. As South Africa returned to being in and among the best in all formats by 2009, Amla's presence in the middle-order has been one of the ingredients of resurgence. However, the monk-like cricketer hit his purple patch in 2010, scoring 1000 plus runs with a staggering average of around 75. His consistency in both, Tests and ODIs is the biggest strength of his cricketing repertoire. Amla took his awe-inspiring form for the next couple of years in ODIs as well as Tests. In 2012, he became the first-ever South African to score a triple ton, when he scored 311 at the Oval.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe name Hashim Amla soon became synonyms for consistency and in the year 2013, he achieved a rare feat by becoming the first batsman since Ricky Ponting to head both the Test and ODI rankings of ICC. Amla was also handed the Test captaincy of the national team in 2014 but failed to deliver in the leadership role. He eventually stepped down.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nPost the 2015 World Cup where the Proteas reached the semi-final, Hashim Amla has not been his same self. There was a consistent decline in his form and the run-machine that we knew went through a lean phase. Although time and again Hashim played some extraordinary knocks to keep reminding everyone about his class. Soon after a disappointing 2019 Cricket World Cup for him and South Africa, the bearded maestro announced his retirement from international cricket.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe ultimate cricketing gentleman, Hashim Amla was the epitome of class, style and calm elegance who has immensely inspired the next generation. He left behind a glorious legacy for the world of cricket. At the time of his retirement, Amla held the record for the fastest to reach 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000 ODI runs along with the most ODI tons for South Africa. With over 18,000 international runs in his kitty, one of the best Protea batsmen had an illustrious career and cricket will remember him for his monk-like patience and humility.  </p>",

        "description": "<p>Once in every generation comes an athlete who redefines the meaning of the game. They are born with an abundance of talent, immense amount of natural ability, and they could do things which others could only dream about. Roger Federer is that athlete for Tennis, Tiger Woods for Golf and for Cricket, it is Mr. 360 - Abraham Benjamin de Villiers.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nDe Villiers debuted in late 2004 against a visiting England, partnering Graeme Smith as an opener. In his second Test in the same series, he replaced injured Mark Boucher and took over wicket-keeping duties from the veteran. It also led to some chopping and changing in the batting line-up as he was demoted down the order. The move worked well though as he scored a fifty in the second innings of the Test which got his career going. In the last match of the series, back as an opener, he went on to register scores of 92 and 109 while opening the innings and announced his arrival in Test cricket with a bang!</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHowever, in ODIs, it took a while for ABD to find his footing as he recorded his first half-century on his 17th attempt, against Australia. Once fully settled with the international duties, he became one of South Africa's most consistent performers in all three formats and became a mainstay in their side. All this despite not having a defined role in the batting order as he was deployed as an opener, middle or lower order batsman, depending on the situation. The right-hander had no qualms in adapting to any of them and took every opportunity in his stride. His prowess behind the wickets was highly regarded as he was touted as Boucher's eventual successor and he was often called to deputize for him as well.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAB de Villiers' presence in the South African batting line-up was vital. He was a major factor in registering historic wins in Australia and going on a 3-year unbeaten run since 2007. He also helped his team to a semi-final berth in the 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup, restoring respectability after a poor showing in the tournament's previous editions.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn the year 2008, he stroked a double century in Ahmedabad and became the first South African to do so against India. Later in 2010, he notched up the highest individual score in Tests for the Proteas when he scored 278* which was surpassed by Hashim Amla after he cracked a triple ton against England in 2012.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nConsistent performances over the years gave the Proteas a new ODI captain in de Villiers, when he replaced Graeme Smith in 2011, post the World Cup. AB showed his mastery in the Test arena as well as ODIs as he topped the ICC batting rankings on several occasions and played a momentous role for South Africa in their quest to return to the pinnacle of cricket.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAB was a hot-buy in the Indian T20 League and started off by representing Delhi until he moved to Bangalore for the later seasons, where he was retained by the team. He also represented the Titans in South Africa's domestic T20 competition and was an important player for all the three above teams.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nDe Villiers was one such player who possessed the ability to destroy best of the bowling line-ups with his effortless yet aggressive batting style. One such instance came in the 2015 World Cup in Australia when he destroyed West Indies' bowling and went on to score 162 runs off 66 balls, leading South Africa to their second-highest total in World Cup history (408) at the Sydney Cricket Ground. A month prior to the mega event, he had scored a 16-ball fifty and 31-ball century against the same team.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe ability to offer dead bats, classical drives, flicks and pulls and his instinctive nature to innovate in manners, unimaginable to the cricket-kind, de Villiers turned into one of the most dangerous cricketers the sport has ever seen.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nOn May 23, 2018, AB de Villiers announced his shocking retirement from all forms of international cricket and jolted the entire cricketing world with his decision. After 114 Tests, 228 ODIs and 78 T20Is and a combined total of 20,014 runs in international cricket, he said 'I have had my turn, and to be honest, I am tired. It is time for others to take over.'  At the time of his retirement, he held the record for the fastest 50, 100 and 150 in ODI history.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The relatively quick metamorphosis of Dale Steyn from an express bowler to an express world class bowler mirrors South Africa's progress from mediocrity to world beaters. Inspired by the generation of Lees and Akhtars, the shortcomings on pace alone were grasped sooner by Steyn than his contemporaries. With a mixture of accuracy and swing to combine with pace, he soon rose to the pinnacle of Test bowling to become one of cricket's most dangerous strike bowlers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the tour to Sri Lanka in 2006 where bulk wickets at irregular intervals were masked by an economy rate higher than six, led to him being dropped in the return series against Pakistan in the same year. However, he was recalled for the subsequent Test series against New Zealand. He ended up playing both Tests, dismantling the Kiwis with 10 wickets in each of them, leading South Africa to historic victories.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt was a timely improvement as veteran Shaun Pollock announced his retirement a few months later. Following the New Zealand tour, Steyn's bowling displays often revolved around refreshing discipline with a decrease in economy. On the tour to Australia in 2008-09, in tandem with Makhaya Ntini, Steyn helped South Africa clinch their first Test series win against the Aussies. He added another 10-wicket haul to his credit in Melbourne, in a match which the Proteas won by 9 wickets. In Nagpur, Steyn inflicted an innings defeat on India when he picked up a 10-fer in the game which included his career best 7/51 in the first innings. Indian T20 League contracts too, ensued soon after with Steyn penning a jackpot deal with Bangalore and then with Hyderabad.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn one of the most devastating spells in Test cricket in February 2013, Steyn rattled Pakistan helping South Africa bundle them out for 49 with breathtaking figures of 6-8. While comparisons with contemporaries continue, it is fair to say Steyn's consistency over large periods has been unmatched in the modern era of cricket, already making him the best fast bowling product following the turn of the millennium. Steyn is well on his way to becoming the leading wicket-taker for South Africa in Tests.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe continued his brilliant year taking 30 wickets of his next 7 Test matches rattling the opposition's batting line-up. Steyn was pretty successful in World T20 too, taking nine wickets of five matches and bowled one of the best over of T20 history when he defended seven runs of the last over against New Zealand. Steyn was retained by his Hyderabad franchise at the starting of the seventh season of Indian T20 League.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In the late 90s and during Greg Chappell's coaching era, when heads were tumbling through the Indian team's turmoil, it seems all that Mahendra Singh Dhoni did was chalk out a plan on how things would change for the better. When granted the opportunity to lead, he showed himself ready and emerged as the solution to most of India's problems, enough to finally fulfill expectations of a long-suffering crowd of supporters.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAn Adam Gilchrist-inspired Dhoni was drafted in 2004 to solve India's wicketkeeper-batsman crisis after the failure of the Rahul Dravid experiment. His start was anything but legendary - getting out for a duck. It was his fifth outing at home against Pakistan in 2005, where he stroked a blistering 148, making everyone sit up and take notice. A mammoth 183 to chase a high Sri Lankan total later in the year reiterated his value. By the end of 2005, Dhoni donned the all-whites to earn a Test cap against Sri Lanka. In the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 that followed, Dhoni was chosen to lead a young Indian side. Under his guidance, the team quickly turned disappointment to joy by lifting the coveted trophy, to the surprise of both fans and detractors. His ability to excel in leadership was quickly recognized and within a year, he was appointed as the Indian skipper in all forms of the game.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nUnder Dhoni's captaincy, India posted successful Test series victories home (England 2008) and away against New Zealand (2009) and Sri Lanka (2009). Throughout his first five years as a Test player, India had lost only two away series, a record which helped them top the Test rankings. The biggest accomplishment of his career came in 2011 when he powered Team India to a remarkable World Cup victory with his extraordinary leadership skills. It was after 28 long years that India won the Cup, thanks to a bunch of hardworking and enthusiastic cricketers led by a young and exceptionally astute skipper. He played a captain's innings in the final against Sri Lanka, where his brilliant unbeaten knock sealed the most memorable victory for his team and country.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nDhoni’s next adventures were probably his toughest as a skipper. Consecutive tours to England and Australia in 2011/12 were complete disasters as the team was whitewashed both times. Success in Tests continued to evade Dhoni even as he relished the shorter formats. A home series loss to England the following year put question marks on Dhoni’s leadership in the longest format of the game but he did have his way in 2013 when he inflicted on a touring Australian team, a 4-0 whitewash, making him the first captain in a long time to do so. That was followed by winning the ICC Champions Trophy in 2013 making him the only skipper to hold all the major ICC trophies - the T20 WC, the 50-over WC and the Champions Trophy.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe ghosts of 2011 returned to haunt him in 2014 on India’s tour to England and despite a historic win at Lord’s, India went on to lose 1-3, further denting his overseas Test record. On 30th December 2014, having saved the third Test for India against Australia at the MCG, Dhoni announced his retirement from Tests with immediate effect citing too much strain as a captain as the reason, handing over the mantle to Virat Kohli. The 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup proved why he was such a tremendous captain in ODIs. Having failed to win a single game in the Tests in Australia and even the tri-series, the Indian team had a magnificent run in the mega event, winning all their league games and even the quarters, only to fall short against a champion Aussie side in the semis. They were on an 11-match winning streak in World Cups, broken only by that magnificent Clarke-led team.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nDhoni gave up the captaincy of limited-overs teams in early 2017. In the twilight of his career, he still is a key figure in the Indian setup, often being the man that the current captain Virat Kohli looks up to in times of crisis. Apart from being an extremely inspiring leader for India, Dhoni also proved his mettle in franchise cricket by leading Chennai to multiple Indian T20 League titles, the last one being in 2018 and two Champions League T20 silverware (2010,2014). Chennai became the first side in the Indian T20 League to successfully defend their title. His team has been arguably the most consistent side in franchise T20 cricket across the globe. Though he may be aging, he is aging like fine wine and just getting better. When he decides to hang up his gloves, it will be the end of an era, one of the Golden eras that Indian cricket had seen under this legend from Ranchi.</p>",

He traveled a lot with the Indian Test squad before finally getting a chance in the 2013 Test series against Australia.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAjinkya didn’t have the best of debuts but he put it past him and only in his third Test, Rahane scored fifties in both innings in Durban. He was often the man for India away from home in a crisis, he showed that in his maiden Test ton in New Zealand. It was his brilliant century on a green deck at Lord’s in 2014 that really made the world take notice. It set up India’s first win at the venue in 28 years. On the tour Down Under, Rahane scored 399 runs in the four-match Test series. His class in whites has never been in question ever since then.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHe didn’t quite shine in similar fashion in ODIs but scored his maiden ton in Birmingham in 2014. He has had a dwindling time in the 50-over format though with the odd brilliant knock. His 79 against South Africa in the 2015 World Cup was particularly eye-catching. He has been in and out of the ODI side far too often for a player of his caliber.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn the home series in 2016-17, he only had one big score, when he registered his career best Test score of 188 against the Kiwis. He fell away post that but chipped in with vital contributions against Australia. India depend a lot on him and it should be interesting to see how he adapts to changing batting styles in modern cricket.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn the Indian T20 League, he started with Mumbai but his real success came with Rajasthan. A prolific scorer for them at the top of the order, he was the perfect foil for many aggressive opening partners. He was bought by Pune in the 2016 edition of the tournament and had a fairly decent run. Once Rajasthan returned to the League after a 2-year hiatus, Rahane was once again roped in and also made the captain after Steven Smith’s involvement in the infamous sandpaper gate.</p>",

With a solid domestic background, Christian was picked to debut in national colours in a T20I encounter against the West Indies in 2010. He also made it to Australia's T20I side for the 2010 World Twenty20. He went on to make his debut against India in 2012 in the home Tri-series involving Sri Lanka. In this series, he became the fourth Aussie to take a hat-trick in ODIs, which came against Sri Lanka.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, his moment of recognition arrived with an IPL call-up in 2011, where the Deccan Chargers signed him for the fourth season.

Karunaratne was very impressive in the domestic circuit as well as at the U-19 level. Looking at his excellent performances at the domestic level, the young southpaw got his maiden international call-up and Dimuth made his ODI debut against England.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHe was included in Sri Lanka's Test squad touring South Africa in 2011. Though he did not get to play in any of the matches. Being benched in the next few series, he finally found a place in the playing XI after their leading opener Tillakaratne Dilshan got injured. He made his Test debut against New Zealand on 17th November 2012. He got to open the innings with Paranavitana but had a miserable start to his Test career as he got out on a duck. Though he compensated in the second innings of the match as he scored an unbeaten 60 and took his team to victory. His Test career got a boost after he struck his maiden Test century against New Zealand where he scored a tenacious knock of 152 runs which came from 363 balls.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nDimuth Karunaratne was the member of the 15-man squad for the 2015 World Cup but had a forgetful outing as he broke a bone of his right hand during a practice match and was sent back home. Kusal Perera was announced as his replacement.  Since then, Dimuth's prime focus was in the longest format of the game. 2017 was a fruitful year for him as he ended up scoring 1031 runs in Tests and became the second player after Dean Elgar to score more than 1000 Test runs that year. His career-best innings till date has come against Pakistan in a Test match held in Dubai in 2017 where he fell just 4 runs short of his double century. His Test form continued in 2018 where he scored 743 runs in 9 matches at an average of 46.43. His outstanding performances led to his inclusion in the World Test XI by the ICC.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAfter Sri Lanka's former captain Dinesh Chandimal started facing issues with his consistency and form, he was dropped and Karunaratne was given the responsible job to captain the Sri Lankan side. Under his captaincy, the Lankan Lions defeated the South African team in South Africa in Tests and sealed the series 2-0. Thus, Sri Lanka became the first Asian team to win a Test series in South Africa. In 2019, Dimuth was named the captain of the Sri Lanka team for the upcoming ODI World Cup. Leading a pretty imbalanced team, Dimuth failed to do any magic and the Islanders had a mediocre campaign as they ended at the sixth position in the points table. </p>",

        "description": "<p>Son of the former South African coach Ray Jennings, Keaton Jennings is one of the many English cricketers with the South African roots. Born in Johannesburg, as a teenager, the left-handed opening batsman climbed up the ranks in the South African domestic circuit and even led South Africa's Under-19 cricket team on its tour to England in 2011. However, with his mother being an English national, it was during this period that the elegant opener decided to pursue a career as an English cricketer.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe southpaw’s best season for his county team Durham came in 2016, where he averaged 64.5 and became the leading run-scorer. On the back of such a successful county season, Jennings was named in England's Test squad for the final two matches of their India tour, replacing injured Haseeb Hameed.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nOn 8th December 2016, at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, Keaton became the 101st batsman to get a century on debut, scoring 112. However, after the Indian tour, the opener managed to score just 127 runs from the next eight innings and that resulted in Mark Stoneman replacing him as the second opener alongside Alastair Cook. Nonetheless, the constant failure of Stoneman and Jennings’ prolific form in county cricket, meant that Keaton got a reprieve and was recalled in the England team for the second Test against Pakistan in June 2018. </p>",

Duckett amassed 2,706 runs across all formats in a single season with two daddy double hundreds, against Sussex and Kent respectively. He also scored his maiden List A double century, a massive 220 against Sri Lanka A at Canterbury. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuckett's emergence though was far from seamless. His fitness issues kept cropping up time and again. Having being dropped from the England U-19 side in 2013, he was left out of the 2015 pre-season tour to Barbados for the very same reason as well. It was David Ripley, the then Northants coach who turned around Duckett's fortunes. A predominantly middle-order basher, Duckett's career seemed to be going nowhere until he was asked to open. 1,000 runs in the Championship followed and the southpaw had risen from the Ashes. His maiden ODI tour to Bangladesh was promising but that was followed by a tough time in Tests in India where his footwork against spin was exposed.

        "description": "<p>Son of a brick kiln owner, Kuldeep Yadav was a meritorious student and played cricket just for fun. It was his father who wanted him to pursue cricket as a career and took him to coach Kapil Pandey. Yadav started as a fast bowler but was then advised by his coach to switch to left-arm wrist spin. Chinaman bowlers are a rare breed and soon Kuldeep began to master that art.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nKuldeep was first picked in the Indian U19 team as a 17-year old but missed out on the selection for the World Cup. He didn't lose hope though and kept working on his game. Eventually, Yadav got the ticket to 2014 ICC U19 Cricket World Cup where he took a hat-trick against Scotland and finished as the joint second-highest wicket-taker in the tournament.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nYadav was initially in the Mumbai squad in the 2012 season but then he was acquired by Kolkata in 2014. After warming the bench for the entire season, Kuldeep finally got the chance to make his debut in the Champions League. He played a perfect foil to Sunil Narine and impressed with his economical spells. In the same year, Yadav made his maiden First Class and List A appearances as well. He was first selected in the national team for an ODI series against West Indies at home but unfortunately, the tour was withdrawn due to a dispute between the West Indian players and the board.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAfter a wait of almost three years, Kuldeep Yadav eventually made his debut for India, albeit in the longer format of the game. He picked 4/68 against Australia in Dharamsala and took no time in proving his mettle. Soon he was drafted in the Indian ODI squad as well and with the selectors having in mind that the wrist spinners are the way forward, Kuldeep along with Yuzvendra Chahal formed a strong alliance ahead of the 2019 World Cup.</p>",

It was this performance that led to him being signed by Chennai for the sixth edition of the Indian T20 League.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChennai bowling coach Andy Bichel shortlisted him after a day long bowling camp in Chennai in January. He continued the momentum in the Indian T20 League ending up as the second-highest wicket-taker for his franchise, being one of the most consistent and dangerous new ball bowlers. He was resigned by Chennai in the 7th season. The 5ft 11 inch tall pacer has a pretty basic delivery stride and uses the out-swinger as his stock delivery. His heroics for the franchise helped him achieve a maiden call up to the national side for the 2013 Zimbabwe series for the ODIs. He justified his selection by bowling very tightly with figures of 2/26 on debut which got him the man of the match award.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Coming from a humble background in Johannesburg, Kagiso Rabada always knew what is required to be a capable option for the South African bowling arsenal. KG, as he is fondly called, is a fiery pacer who delivers great line and length with attacking attributes and that too at a very young age to establish himself as a bowling prodigy.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nRabada made his List A debut for Gauteng against Border in 2013. Although his debut doesn't define how effective and efficient he will be as a future product for the cricketing fraternity. He was picked for the U19 World Cup in 2014 where his rise to fame began and from there on it's all been rosy for him. Kagiso claimed 14 wickets in 5 matches in the mega event and his hostile spell of 6/25 against Australia created havoc. He was tagged as the most fearsome bowler and finished the tournament as one of the leading wicket-takers.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThis little spark of promise didn't go unnoticed and the selectors made sure he gets enough opportunities to turn this spark into a fire. Rabada made his T20I debut in 2014 against Australia and soon he was picked in the ODI squad for the series against Bangladesh. Kagiso made a smashing ODI debut in 2015 where he picked up a 6-wicket haul against Bangladesh to become only the second bowler to do so on debut and only the second bowler to get a hat-trick on debut.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIt became increasingly difficult to keep eyes away from this speedster and eventually he was selected in the Test team to tour India. So much sunlight on the career at such an early stage made Rabada even more lethal and he proved his mettle in the home Test series against England in 2016. He snapped 22 wickets and picked up a 10-wicket haul in a Test match also.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn January 2018, Kagiso Rabada took five wickets in the first Test match against India and then was eventually ranked number 1 in ICC Test Rankings. Soon, he became the youngest bowler to take 150 Test wickets and was also the leading wicket-taker in the year 2018. Rabada was named the best young player by Wisden and also won CSA's Player of the Year Award.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe word ruthless defines his bowling best and he has been delivering for his team more often than not. The speedster played for Delhi in the Indian T20 League and the year 2019 was very successful for him as he was the second in the list for most wickets in that season. Rabada surely has raised the bar for the quickies and he is destined for greatness.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAlong with Jasprit Bumrah and Pat Cummins, Kagiso Rabada seems to be holding the mantle of the most feared and talented pace bowlers in the world in this generation. The 2019 World Cup will tell how big a match-winner the Protean pacer will be and how his career graph goes. Going by his achievements so far, one should not be surprised if he just goes bigger and better in his cricket accolades.</p>",

It is a combination of skills India has long waited for since the retirement of Kapil Dev. Irfan Pathan gave them hope for a while but then lost his mojo and soon disappeared in the wilderness. India will wish that Pandya keeps working on his game and ends the country’s search for a seam-bowling all-rounder.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIt was in January 2016 that things turned around for Hardik Pandya. He was the leading run-getter in the Syed Mushtaq Ali, a domestic T20 tournament, finishing with 377 runs in 10 innings at an average of 53.85 while maintaining a strike rate of 130.90. He also took 10 wickets and was instrumental in Baroda reaching the finals. His effective all-round show impressed Mumbai and they bought him in the 2015 edition of the Indian T20 League. He hit a 31-ball 61 for Mumbai against Kolkata in his first season to catch the attention of everyone. With the ability to strike big and bowl quick, he was so impressive that the then coach, Ricky Ponting could not stop praising him.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAfter a stellar performance, Pandya was picked for India's tour to Australia in 2015 for the T20Is. He started with a 19-run over on his international debut but came back strongly to almost take a hat-trick. He has had the love for the big stage, in the 2016 World T20, he bowled the last over and defended two runs off three balls against Bangladesh. It is how cruel the sport is at times that it takes you high enough only to make you vulnerable for a big fall. It was off his bowling that Lendl Simmons was dismissed off a no-ball and the West Indian went on to play an unbeaten inning to knock India out in the semi-final. Also not to forget his heroics in the 2017 Champions Trophy final against Pakistan where he struck a 43-ball 76 and gave a real scare to the arch-rivals.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHis exploits in the limited-overs handed him a Test cap for India's tour of South Africa in 2018. There he scored 93 in his first innings and earned a lot of plaudits from around the world. With his captain and management's backing, the Indian selectors took him to England's tour as well. In 2019, Hardik had a bumpy ride as he got into controversies resulted in him getting sent back home from Australia in the middle of the series. After facing a lot of heat due to his derogatory comments in a reality TV show, Hardik made his comeback focused and with a point to prove. The dynamic all-rounder showed irresistible form in the 2019 season of the Indian T20 League and was one of the main reasons for Mumbai's 4th title. With his consistent all-round performance, Pandya cemented his place in the 15-man World Cup squad of India and had a decent outing. </p>",

        "description": "<br />\r\n<p>The Indian T20 League has been the making of many promising young players and Jasprit Bumrah is one of them. Featuring for Mumbai, Bumrah first caught the eye with an unusual bowling action. Blessed with the ability to bowl yorkers and get the steep bounce off the pitch, the Gujarat pacer has arguably become India’s best bowler in limited-overs cricket since making his international debut.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p><br />\r\nJasprit made his T20 debut against Maharashtra in the 2012-13 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and helped Gujarat clinch the title with his Man of the Match performance. After impressing in his debut Indian T20 league season for the Mumbai-based franchise, in the subsequent year, he was again bought by Mumbai for a whopping 1.2 crores.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nBumrah's unusual angle with which he bowls made him a household name in the T20s. The Indian selectors took notice of it and his skills, control, and accuracy got him to the flight to Australia in 2016 for the T20I series. When Mohammed Shami got injured, Bumrah was given the opportunity to make his ODI debut in Sydney before the T20Is. After an impressive outing there, he was given a place in the starting XI for the T20Is and he didn't disappoint as he took six wickets in a Kangaroo-whitewash. After great success during the Australian tour, it came as no surprise when Bumrah soon became the number two ranked T20I bowler in the world. He played Asia Cup and T20I World Cup as well in the same year, spearheading the pace attack and cementing his place.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHis control in the death overs meant that the Indian selectors showed faith in him for the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy also. Though he bowled a no-ball on a wicket delivery to the eventual centurion Fakhar Zaman, he didn't let that setback worry him much. Proving his mantle time and again, Bumrah has been the go-to bowler for Virat Kohli in the shorter formats and eventually, in the Tests as well. During his debut tour of South Africa, in only his third match, he took a fifer and convinced everyone of his potential in the longest format too.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nBumrah was the strike bowler for India in World Cup 2019 and he proved the world why he is the no.1 ranked ODI bowler. The pacer amassed 18 wickets in just 9 matches with an economy of just 4.41 and became the leading wicket-taker for India in the tournament. Jasprit bowled 9 maidens in 2019 World Cup which is also the highest by any bowler in the showpiece event. His yorkers were as deadly as a bullet in this tournament which helped him taking wickets but also led to an injury of his teammate Vijay Shankar after he was struck by Bumrah's yorker on his toe during a net-session.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nPost the 2019 World Cup during India's second Test Championship match against West Indies in Jamaica, Bumrah struck gold as he registered a Test hat-trick to his name, dismissing Darren Bravo, Shamarh Brooks and Roston Chase and became only the third Indian to do so after Harbhajan Singh and Irfan Pathan. With age on his side and an improving skill-set, the promising pacer looks set to log many bowling records for India.</p>\r\n<br />",

        "description": "<p>Mumbai have always done and continue to nurture young prodigies in the world of cricket. One such cricketer is going around by the name of Sarfaraz Naushad Khan. He came into the scene when he made news for smashing 439 runs in his maiden Haris Shield game in 2009. As much as that made him feature in good news, he was also embroiled in a controversy which accused him of fudging his age, before an advanced test revealed otherwise, which was accepted by the Mumbai Cricket Association.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nEventually, he was a part of the Mumbai U-19 side. Some decent outings there led to his inclusion in the Indian U-19 team. He had a good outing in the quadrangular U-19 series involving the Under-19 teams of South Africa, Australia and Zimbabwe apart from India. That eventually paved way for him to represent India in the Under-19 World Cup in 2014. He batted freely with an average of over 70 and a strike rate in excess of 100. This was not a one-off instance, as in the next edition of the U-19 World Cup, he was the second highest run-scorer in the competition.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nWith some good exploits behind him, expectations about Sarfaraz making it to the highest level began to soar. The first step in that direction was taken when he was picked up by the Bengaluru franchise in the Indian Twenty20 League in 2015. He displayed his cheeky aggressiveness when he was often sent lower down the order to finish the innings.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn July 2015, Sarfaraz left Mumbai and joined Uttar Pradesh for the 2015-16 domestic season. That the investment on him was not just one-off, it was seen by the fact that he was one of Bangalore’s three retentions going into the auction for the 2018 Indian T20 League. He had been a part of Bangalore's squad since 2015 but in December 2018, he was bought by Punjab in the player auction for the 2019 Indian T20 League.</p>",

He was also only the second opener from Lancashire to play for the national side since Michael Atherton last played in 2001. His inclusion wasn’t a surprise given his exploits in the domestic circuit and at the Under-19 level.</p>\r\n<p>Born and brought up in Lancashire, Hameed was always touted for greater success in life. He made his First-Class debut against Glamorgan at Manchester in 2015, scoring a 119-ball 28. The accolades never stopped for him despite a sedate start to his FC career. \"Hameed is one of the best young players I've seen in a long time\" said Andrew Gale, the captain of the Yorkshire county team against whom Hameed hit two tons in a single game, his first ever Roses (Yorkshire vs Lancashire) match. A breakthrough season in the Championship followed with him scoring 1,200 runs at an average of 49.9. He became the youngest to score 1,000 runs for Lancashire, going past a record held by Atherton.</p>\r\n<p>Hameed came through the ranks with a stellar performance in the U-19 series against South Africa, piling up 389 runs in 5 games - the most by any batsman in a youth bilateral one-day series. It was this series that got Hameed a contract with Lancashire and the rest as they say is history.</p>",

He was also a part of the Northerns team that lifted the Africa Cup T20 in 2015. In May 2017, Aiden was awarded as the Domestic Newcomer of the Year by Cricket South Africa.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nSeeing Markram's talent, he was drafted in South Africa's Test team and he made his debut in 2017 against Bangladesh. Aiden had a fantastic start to his Test career, scoring 97 in the first Test and then getting his maiden Test ton in the second. Soon, Markram was included in the ODI side as well and he scored a half-century in his very first outing in the South African colours.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn February of 2018 when India was touring South Africa, the regular skipper, Faf du Plessis, suffered a finger injury and Aiden was given the charge of the team in his absence ahead of Quinton de Kock, JP Duminy and David Miller. He was 23 years old at that time and became the second youngest player to lead South Africa after Graeme Smith.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAn aggressive batsman by nature, Markram was seen as the replacement for AB de Villiers and he has done justice to his selection. His classic batting display in all formats has forced the cricket community to take note of him and with age on his side, he can be the next big thing in South African cricket. </p>",

A tall figure, strong build and fierce pace with an easy action constitute an ideal pacer and he has most of it. Among the many intriguing of pacers choosing the way, Ngidi’s non-affordability of batting kits chose him to turn into a fast bowler.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHis first international appearance for the Proteas was in a T20I against Sri Lanka in early 2017. That match turned out to be 10-overs-a-side one due to rain and Ngidi impressed all with his economy and pace then. He was also named in the subsequent ODI series against the same opponent that followed. But an abdominal injury meant that his maiden ODI appearance had to wait.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nLungi was dubbed to be a limited overs specialist initially. Hence, it took a few by surprise when he was handed his Test cap against India in early 2018. However, whoever had an ounce of doubt about his ability with the red ball would have got it cleared. A 6-wicket haul in the second innings, that helped South Africa win that match. In the following ODI series, he did feature but had no great impact then.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHis exploits, though, didn’t go unnoticed and Chennai snared him up for the 2018 season of the Indian T20 League. He didn't set the stage on fire but played a vital role in his team's title triumph. </p>",

Averaging more than 45 in First-class cricket, the 23-year old was finally successful in grabbing the selector's attention. In November 2018, Islam was named in Bangladesh's Test squad for the series against West Indies and made his debut in whites during the 2nd Test at his home ground, Dhaka. Shadman quickly repaid the faith shown in him as he scored a gritty knock of 76 from 199 deliveries. A couple of months later, he toured New Zealand with the Test squad and adapted to the alien conditions reasonably well. However, he got good starts, he failed to make big scores. In a short period, Shadman impressed with his compact technique and emerged as a handy choice to open with Tamim Iqbal.  </p>",

Unfortunately, the young batsman failed to enter South Africa's U-19 squad for the World Cup but he didn't lose hope.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn December 2014, a determined Zubayr struck his maiden double century in a First-class game and became the fourth-youngest South African (19 years and 113 days) to achieve this feat. After notching up few impressive performances in 2018, Hamza was promoted to Cape Cobras team for the 2018-19 season. A phenomenal domestic season handed Hamza an opportunity in the whites.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHamza made his Test debut in the third Test against Pakistan in early 2019 and became South Africa's 100th Test player since readmission. He had a rather disappointing debut as his figures of 41 and 0 did not live up to the expectations. After getting ignored by the selectors in the following Test series against Sri Lanka, in August 2019, Hamza was named in South Africa's Test squad for their series against India.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Coming from a football crazy family, James Alexander Porter is an English cricketer who has played first-class cricket for Essex since 2014. He is a slim and lanky medium-fast seam bowler with speeds in the range of 80 mph. His main strength lies in moving the ball both ways, off the seam and in the air. This made him a big threat for the batsmen, especially in the seam and swing-friendly English conditions.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIt was during the 2005 Ashes when a 12-year-old Porter fell in love with cricket and to play for England became his ultimate dream. In the 2011/12 season, Porter attended the Darren Lehmann Cricket Academy. His talent was noticed and he was selected in the Essex Second XI team. The pacer was then selected in the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) Young Cricketers squad in 2013. Even after playing second-team cricket for 3 years for the MCC Young Cricketers and Chingford CC in the Essex League, the teenager was not able to get into the Essex or Middlesex County teams.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nGiven where he was during the winter of 2013-14, Porter started contemplating giving up cricket and even took a job as a recruitment consultant. However, in the 2014 season, the young seamer decided to give cricket one last go with Essex. He put in some impressive performances for the Essex second XI team. With Porter doing well for his club side and the Essex team facing some injury issues with some of its main players, the medium pacer was selected in the Essex County team. He made his first-class debut against Kent in September 2014 and took a wicket with his fifth ball in senior cricket. After that, it was no looking back for the youngster.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nPorter played his first full season for Essex in 2015 where he picked up more than 50 wickets. In the first 10 County Championship matches, Porter picked up 38 wickets and immediately announced his arrival. In 2015, during a match against the touring Australians, Porter picked up six wickets to further prove his potential. A testimony of Porter's confidence and competitive nature was on display when in the tour game against Australia, the youngster got rid of the fiery opener David Warner. Interestingly, before the game, he had vowed to take his wicket. In the summer of 2016, Jamie picked up 55 Division Two wickets and was the key to Essex winning the County Championship and getting promoted to Division One.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn 2017 season, Porter continued to take giant strides in his career. On the back of his contribution to the Essex team that year, James was named one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year, in April 2018. Soon after that, he was handed his maiden call-up for the national team for the Test series against India. </p>",

        "description": "<p>There are some people who crumble when they are put under pressure and then there are those who rise higher than anyone ever imagined. Such a person is Jhye Richardson. Since he was young, he was told that he would not succeed as a pacer due to his physical attributes. With a stature of 178 cms and 70 odd kilos, even his coaches told that he would not get to the top. But come the 2018-2019 season for the Australian national team, there was a new kid on the block challenging established bowlers like Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and he was giving them a good run for their money.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nA small man with whippy fast-arm action, Richardson is a right-arm fast bowler who can swing the ball in both directions. Richardson made his List A debut at the tender age of 19 years for Western Australia. In December 2015, he was named in Australia's squad for the U-19 ICC World Cup. He made his mark in the Big Bash League in 2016 for Perth Scorchers. In the final of the tournament, he rattled the middle order of Sydney Sixers taking 3 wickets and giving away just 30 runs. He was adjudged 'Man of the Match' for his performance and he hasn't looked back since then. He made his first-class debut for Western Australia in March 2016.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nSince then his progression has been rapid. Richardson made his international bow in a T20I against Sri Lanka in February 2017, aged just 20 years. He made his ODI debut against England almost a year after. He was also included in the Test squad of Australia's tour of South Africa in 2018. However, he did not make an appearance in any of the matches and missed out on his Test debut. In April 2018, he was awarded a national contract by Cricket Australia for the 2018–19 season.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn January 2019, the selectors showed faith in Richardson by selecting him for India's tour of Australia. He was not in the best of forms preceding that series. However, he came with his 'A' game to face India. In the first match at the Sydney Cricket Ground, he recorded his career-best figures of 4/26. He dismissed Indian skipper Virat Kohli thrice in three ODIs in the series, thereby displaying his true potential. He was re-selected for Sri Lanka's tour of Australia after Josh Hazlewood got injured. He made his Test debut in January 2019, taking three wickets in the first innings. His control on pace, pitching and swing grew as he gained more and more experience.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHe was selected in Australia's squad for the ICC World Cup 2019. The ICC named him as one of the five exciting talents to make their World Cup debuts. Unfortunately for Jhye, he was ruled out of the tournament due to a dislocated shoulder. He was replaced by Kane Richardson in the squad. Jhye will be looking to make a good comeback after recovering from the injury and become a regular starter for Australia. </p>",

He took 2 wickets but had an expensive outing as Colin Munro took on the District's bowlers and hit them all over the park. In the end, Central Districts lost the match by an innings and 64 runs. Tickner made the selectors take notice of him when he took a hat-trick in 2017 against Wellington in the 2017-18 Plunkett Shield season.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nTickner was on fire in the 2017-18 Super Smash T20 league in New Zealand where he ended up as the highest wicket-taker (21 wickets in 11 matches). He continued to perform well for Central Districts and was awarded a contract for the 2018-19 season. He was called up to the national squad for the T20I series against India and made his debut in the third match at Seddon Park.  </p>",

        "description": "<p>Rishabh Pant belongs to the Adam Gilchrist school of Cricketology, a dashing left-handed batsman who keeps wickets as well for his side. Originally from Uttarakhand, Pant had to shift bases quite a few times from a tender age as he targeted playing cricket at the highest level. It was the 2016 U-19 World Cup that brought him fame across the country. He smashed a record-breaking fifty against Nepal while also racking up a ton against Namibia soon after. Unlike most southpaws, Pant's strength is mostly in the arc between mid on and square leg as his terrific bat swing causes mayhem on the bowlers. He does pepper the off side too but not as much as the usual left-handed batsman. Picked by the Delhi franchise in the Indian T20 League in 2016, Pant has already shown his skills with quite a few explosive knocks.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAlthough he burst onto the scene as a batsman for the limited-overs format, Pant has also scaled greater heights for Delhi in the domestic circuit as far as the four-day format is concerned. He smashed a historical century off just 48 balls in the 2016-17 season while also becoming one of the youngest ever batsmen to record a triple century. Pant finished among the top five run-getters of the season and what stood out was his astonishing strike rate of 107 - unimaginable in this format especially considering his staggering consistency.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAfter his mighty batting display for Delhi in the Indian T20 league in 2018, the selectors took a chance with him in the shortest format of the game. He went with the national T20I squad to Sri Lanka to play in the Nidahas trophy 2017. Though he didn't do much in that tournament to justify his selection, Pant was shown faith for the Test squad in the touring Indian team to England in 2018.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nPant's keeping has been safe and the young lad has shown eagerness to learn with every game which is pleasing. With MS Dhoni at the twilight of his career, Pant appears to be the perfect successor to keep the legacy going for the wicketkeeper-batsman slot in the Indian team.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Dominic Mark Bess is an English off-spinning all-rounder hailing from Sidmouth in Devon. He joined the Somerset Cricket Academy when he was just 16 and also represented England at the Under-19 level. In the 2015/16 season, he got a chance to travel to Adelaide to train in the Darren Lehmann Cricket Academy.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe young and talented cricketer started his professional cricketing journey in 2016 when he was selected by the Somerset County Club. It was not an ideal start for his first-class career but later that year, in the County Championship, the off-spinner got another opportunity to showcase his talent when he was picked to play against Warwickshire. His life changed immediately after that as he took 6 for 21 on his Championship debut which included the likes of Ian Bell and Jonathan Trott on successive deliveries. He finished with match figures of 8-59 and soon followed it up with figures of 5-43 against Nottinghamshire, thereby further justifying his talent and skill. In the 2017 county season, Bess ended up taking 36 wickets at 23.42 and proved that he was now ready for a national call.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHis biggest day in cricket came when he made his Test debut for England against Pakistan on 24th May 2018 at Lord's. Just before the match, his county mate Jack Leach broke his thumb and that was when the selectors turned to Bess as a replacement. In his debut Test, even though he was unable to pick a single scalp in the match, Bess impressed with the willow in hand scoring 57 and also shared a century stand with Jos Buttler in England's second innings. </p>",

A few months later, Islam made his List A debut representing the Mohammedan Sporting Club. Islam switched to Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protishtan team and came into prominence in his second domestic season amassing 440 runs in 13 matches. Aminul topped his team's run-chart with his extraordinary batting figures and was quick in grabbing the attention of the selectors. Following a successful domestic season in August 2019, he was named in Bangladesh's training camp ahead of the 2019-20 season. The young batsman didn't take much time in entering the international scenario. In the next month itself, he was picked in the national team after Bangladesh decided to revamp their squad midway through the tri-nation series involving Afghanistan and Zimbabwe.  </p>",

And it hasn't disappointed till now as Prithvi Shaw took the torch in his hand and marched forward when he successfully led his national team to the Under-19 World Cup glory in 2018.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHis name was cropping up in newspapers for all the right reasons. When he was just 14, he blasted 546 off 330 balls in an innings which contained 85 boundaries and 5 maximums. He did it when he was playing for his school Rizvi Springfield in the Harris Shield. Though it's a minors' cricket competition, it has been known to produce such performances time and again.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nShaw once again came into the limelight when he was a part of India's Under-19 youth Asia cup winning squad in November 2016 in Sri Lanka. Since then, his name has been put to the banners like once it was done for the then prodigy, Sachin Tendulkar. He made the comparisons even more concrete when he hit centuries in both his Ranji Trophy and Duleep Trophy debuts - a record previously held by Sachin Tendulkar.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nPrithvi added another feather in his cap when the Delhi-based franchise in the Indian T20 League bid Rs. 1.2 cr for the untested right-handed opening batsman. His Brian Lara-esque backlift earned him a lot of plaudits as he went on to gather fans all over India in the tournament with his classy drives and flicks.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn August 2018, he was called up to India's Test squad for the final two Tests against England, but he did not play. He then made his first international appearance on 4th October 2018 against the Windies in a home Test and became the second-youngest Indian after Tendulkar to make a Test century on debut. He performed really well in the second Test as well and was named the Player of the Series. Consequently, he was named in the Test squad to tour Down Under but unfortunately, a freak injury caused him to miss the first Test and then eventually the remainder of the series.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nShaw's career hit a roadblock in 2019 when he was banned by the BCCI for doping violation. In the press release, it was mentioned that Prithvi had inadvertently ingested a prohibited substance which can be commonly found in the cough syrups. The young boy took it in his stride and accepted his fate with all sincerity.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nPrithvi still has a long road ahead of him but the signs of being a long, prosperous and triumphant career are all there. Already being acclaimed as the next big thing since Virat Kohli in the Indian cricket, Prithvi Pankaj Shaw could well write new chapters in the cricketing history.</p>",

The left-arm pacer hails from Rajasthan and plies his trade in the domestic scene for Delhi.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nKhejroliya made his First Class debut in the 2017-18 season against Assam. He picked up 18 wickets in the season, including a six-fer in the semi-final of the Ranji Trophy. But much before this, he was signed up as an uncapped player by Mumbai for the Indian T20 League in 2017. He wasn’t seen in action then, though.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn his debut List A season in 2016-17, he was the leading wicket-taker for Delhi. His economy rate also impressed many. His form in limited overs continued. In the following year, he was again the leading wicket-taker for Delhi in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. It wouldn’t be entirely wrong in stating that he bowled Delhi to a win in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. He led the wickets chart for his side, which ended up being victorious.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nOn the back of these outings, Bengaluru snaffled him up in the auction of the 2018 edition of the Indian T20 League. With such performances behind him, Khejroliya can hope of getting exposure as well as some game time in the multi-starred T20 tournament. That he has turned tables won’t be an understatement as he served tables at a restaurant in Goa, before enrolling into Sanjay Bharadwaj’s cricket academy, from where he was spotted and picked initially. </p>",
