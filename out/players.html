medium-pacer born in Agra, Uttar Pradesh. He represents Rajasthan in the domestic circuit. His career started on a bad note after he got rejected by Greg Chappell, the Director of Rajasthan Cricket Academy in 2008.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nThat rejection only made Chahar stronger as he announced his arrival in the domestic circuit with a bang. In a great display of swing bowling, Chahar hunted down 8 wickets and that helped Rajasthan in bundling out Hyderabad for a score of just 21, which is also the lowest total in domestic cricket. Post that, Chahar had a bumpy ride due to fitness issues which reflected in his bowling form as well. He though continued to work hard and made immense progress in his fitness and gameplay, thus leading to a successful 2018 Syed Mushtaq-Ali Trophy. That turned out to be the turning point of his life as his performance got him picked by the Chennai franchise for the Indian T20 League.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nChahar made outstanding use of the opportunity and was a regular wicket-taker for the yellow team, most importantly in the Powerplays. Under Dhoni's guidance, the young man's bowling shone and he was a key member of Chennai's successful season in 2018.

Deepak finished as the highest wicket-taker in that series and further proved his mettle. His hard work paid off when he finally got an international call up in 2018 after Jasprit Bumrah got injured. Deepak made his T20I debut against England on July 8, 2018.

Chahar made his ODI debut in the same year in September against Afghanistan but once again it was a below-par performance by him. His ability to swing the ball and pick wickets made the selectors keep faith in his talent and although Chahar missed the bus for the 2019 World Cup, he travelled with the team as one of the four net bowlers. Soon after the mega event, Deepak was picked in the T20I squad for the tour of West Indies.Â \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cbr /\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eDuring Bangladesh's tour of India in 2019, Chahar showed great form and in the T20I decider in Nagpur, he became the first Indian bowler to pick a hat-trick in this format and also finished with bowling figures of 3.2-0-7-6, the best by any bowler.

His family realized his keenness regarding the sport and that is the reason they shifted from Bikaner to Jaipur. He joined the Rajashtan Cricket Academy and got to train under famous coaches which shaped his career.
