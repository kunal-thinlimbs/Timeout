He represents Rajasthan in the domestic circuit. His career started on a bad note after he got rejected by Greg Chappell, the Director of Rajasthan Cricket Academy in 2008.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThat rejection only made Chahar stronger as he announced his arrival in the domestic circuit with a bang. In a great display of swing bowling, Chahar hunted down 8 wickets and that helped Rajasthan in bundling out Hyderabad for a score of just 21, which is also the lowest total in domestic cricket. Post that, Chahar had a bumpy ride due to fitness issues which reflected in his bowling form as well. He though continued to work hard and made immense progress in his fitness and gameplay, thus leading to a successful 2018 Syed Mushtaq-Ali Trophy. That turned out to be the turning point of his life as his performance got him picked by the Chennai franchise for the Indian T20 League.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nChahar made outstanding use of the opportunity and was a regular wicket-taker for the yellow team, most importantly in the Powerplays. Under Dhoni's guidance, the young man's bowling shone and he was a key member of Chennai's successful season in 2018. The pacer took the confidence forward and was among the top three wicket-takers in the following season.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nHis commendable performance in the Indian T20 League led to his inclusion in India A squad for the tri-series against West Indies A and England Lions. Deepak finished as the highest wicket-taker in that series and further proved his mettle. His hard work paid off when he finally got an international call up in 2018 after Jasprit Bumrah got injured. Deepak made his T20I debut against England on July 8, 2018. Though he had a forgetful start to his international career.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nOpportunity knocked again on his door as this time he was given a chance in the 50-over format. Chahar made his ODI debut in the same year in September against Afghanistan but once again it was a below-par performance by him. His ability to swing the ball and pick wickets made the selectors keep faith in his talent and although Chahar missed the bus for the 2019 World Cup, he travelled with the team as one of the four net bowlers. Soon after the mega event, Deepak was picked in the T20I squad for the tour of West Indies.Â </p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>During Bangladesh's tour of India in 2019, Chahar showed great form and in the T20I decider in Nagpur, he became the first Indian bowler to pick a hat-trick in this format and also finished with bowling figures of 3.2-0-7-6, the best by any bowler. His amazing run continued in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy where he snapped another hat-trick within two days.</p>","battingStyle":"Right Handed","bowlingStyle":"Right-arm medium"},{"name":"Chetan Dinesh Bist","playerID":"64390","birthPlace":"India","dob":"03/09/1989","description":null,"battingStyle":"Right Handed","bowlingStyle":"-"},{"name":"Arjit Ramesh Gupta","playerID":"64769","birthPlace":"India","dob":"12/09/1989","description":null,"battingStyle":"Right Handed","bowlingStyle":"Right-arm medium"},{"name":"Aniket Vinod Choudhary","playerID":"56974","birthPlace":"India","dob":"28/01/1990","description":"<p>Hailing from Rajasthan, Aniket Choudhary is a left-arm medium pacer who debuted for his state in 2011 against Rest Of India. He loved cricket from childhood but had to do away with playing basketball as his school did not have a cricket team. Although he kept practicing cricket inside his house with a light ball and bat. His family realized his keenness regarding the sport and that is the reason they shifted from Bikaner to Jaipur. He joined the Rajashtan Cricket Academy and got to train under famous coaches which shaped his career. After consistent performances in the domestic circuit, he was signed by Mohali for the sixth season of the Indian T20 League. However, he didn't get any game to play.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nChoudhary suffered a hamstring injury in 2016 and unfortunately it came during the period of the Indian T20 League auctions. It kept him out of the game for three months. In order to recover, he went to the MRF academy. Glenn McGrath played a big role in helping him with his training. The Australian great bettered his technique and taught him how to develop a strong mindset.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAniket came into the limelight when he was called up by the Indian team management to bowl in the nets before the home Test series against New Zealand. All the other bowlers in the Indian setup were right-handed and that worked to his advantage. This tactic was adopted so that the famed Indian batting line-up could prepare themselves to counter the pace and swing of Boult and Wagner. He was also roped in before the 4-match Test series against Australia for the same reason. Media reported that he was brought in to tackle the threat of Mitchell Starc. Those experiences helped him gain confidence.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn 2017, he was grabbed by Bangalore in the Indian T20 League auctions for a handsome amount which was way more than his base price. He got to play five games for his franchise, fared decently but was not able to do something eye-catching. The positive thing is that he is still young and will only improve with experience. He needs to keep performing for his state and Central Zone. A national selection is what any young cricketer aspires for and he needs to keep working towards his dream to represent India.</p>","battingStyle":"Right Handed","bowlingStyle":"Left-arm medium"},{"name":"Ashok Lakshminarayan Meenaria","playerID":"5121","birthPlace":"India","dob":"29/10/1990","description":"<p>Ashok Menaria is a left-hand batsman and a slow left-arm orthodox bowler from Rajasthan.

Many speculated him to take over the spin reins after Anil Kumble's retirement but sadly the youngster has flattered to deceive.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>The UP lad who made his domestic debut aged 17 consequently made it to India's 2006 Under-19 World Cup squad and after a stellar campaign, became one of India's youngest ever players to be handed a Test cap when he debuted against England in 2006. However, over the years, stiff competition and some lackluster performances resulted in him being shunted from the side but selectors continued to keep him in the loop. He was included in the 15-member Indian squad for the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup, and while he played only a few games without making much impact, he will live to tell the tale of how he was a part of a winning team. In 2012, he was a surprise inclusion in the Test side for the New Zealand series as well as the Indian T20I squad for the World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka later that year. He returned to play his third Test, after 4 years, against England at Nagpur in December 2012 where he picked up 4/69 in the first innings. In August 2013, he joined Somerset as their overseas player for the last five weeks of the season.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>A natural leggie who is not afraid to give the ball air, Chawla's armoury also includes a good googly and a deceptive straighter one. A decent left-hander batsman, Chawla is yet to prove his mettle in the international arena but he does have the potential to be a genuine all-rounder in the future provided that he works consistently on his game. He enjoyed a fair amount of success in the Indian T20 League playing for the Punjab franchise for six seasons from 2008 to 2013. For the 2014 edition, Kolkata shelled out an impressive 4.25 crores to acquire his services.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>From the 2017-18 Ranji Trophy season, Chawla switched from Uttar Pradesh to Gujarat and was the leading wicket-taker for them in that edition with 32 wickets in six games. In January 2018, Piyush was bought back by Kolkata in the mega-auction for the 2018 Indian T20 League through RTM and continues to be an important member of their unit.</p>","battingStyle":"Left Handed","bowlingStyle":"Leg break"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
